### About

This repository includes the Jupyter notebook used for data analysis in the article 'Data Management Plan for Healthcare: Following FAIR Principles and Addressing Cybersecurity Aspects. A Systematic Review using InstructGPT'.

To be able to use the InstructGPT model it is necessary to obtain the API key from OpenAI, and then to add it to an .env file. More details here:
