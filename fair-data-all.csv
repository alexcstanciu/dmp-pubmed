000-532-248-872-978,Factors Affecting Proximal Colon Cleansing Based on Bowel Movement Kinetics: A Prospective Observational Study.,2019,journal article,Gastroenterology research and practice,Hindawi Limited,Egypt,Dae Bum Kim; Kang-Moon Lee; Sung-Goo Kang; Sung Hoon Jung,"Background. Previous studies have suggested that relatively poor bowel preparation in the proximal colon, compared to that in the distal colon, could decrease the usefulness of colonoscopy. The aim of this study was to determine whether the “first defecation time” after polyethylene glycol (PEG) administration affects the cleansing quality in the proximal colon. Methods. A total of 425 individuals who were scheduled to undergo a screening colonoscopy were enrolled prospectively at the healthcare center of St. Vincent’s Hospital, Suwon, Korea, between April 2015 and March 2016. Bowel cleansing was performed using 4 L of PEG. Surveys were conducted to obtain information regarding the “first defecation time.” Endoscopists assessed the quality of bowel preparation in each bowel segment. Results. We investigated 425 consecutive eligible cases. The mean “first defecation time” after PEG administration was 54.35 min. The quality of bowel preparation was poorer in the proximal colon than that in the distal colon. The adequate (excellent, good) and inadequate (fair, poor) proximal colon preparation groups comprised 360 (84.7%) and 65 (15.3%) patients, respectively. A multivariate analysis revealed that female gender ( ), small waist circumference ( ), and the long “first defecation time” ( ) were independently associated with inadequate bowel preparation in the proximal colon. Conclusion. Our data document that the “first defecation time,” female gender, and a small waist circumference affect the quality of preparation in the proximal colon. Inadequate preparation in the proximal colon was more common in females. Patients with these factors undergoing colonoscopy should be monitored carefully.",Defecation; Internal medicine; Observational study; Waist; Colonoscopy; Screening colonoscopy; Inadequate bowel preparation; Proximal colon; Bowel preparation; Medicine; Gastroenterology,,,10.1155/2019/7032971,true
000-607-221-402-259,Using the behavior change wheel to identify barriers to and potential solutions for primary care clinical guideline use in four provinces in South Africa.,2018,journal article,BMC health services research,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,United Kingdom,Tamara Kredo; Sara Cooper; Amber Abrams; Jocelyn Muller; Jimmy Volmink; Salla Atkins,"Clinical practice guidelines risk having little impact on healthcare if not effectively implemented. Theory informed, targeted implementation may maximise their impact. Our study explored barriers to and facilitators of guideline implementation and use by South African primary care nurses and allied healthcare workers in four provinces in South Africa. We also proposed interventions to address the issues identified. We used qualitative research methods, comprising focus group discussions using semi-structured topic guides. Seven focus group discussions were conducted (48 providers) in four South African provinces (Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Kwazulu-Natal, Limpopo). Participants included mostly nurses, dieticians, dentists, and allied health practitioners, from primary care facilities in rural and peri-urban settings. The analysis proceeded in three phases. Firstly, two analysts conducted inductive thematic content analysis to develop themes of data. This was followed by fitting emergent themes to the Theoretical Domains Framework and finally to the associated Behaviour Change Wheel to identify relevant interventions. Participants are knowledgeable about guidelines, generally trust their credibility and are receptive and motivated to use them. Guidelines are seen by nurses to provide confidence and reassurance, as well as professional authority and independence where doctors are scarce. Barriers to guideline use include: inadequate systems for printed book distribution, insufficient and substandard photocopies, linguistic inappropriateness (e.g. complicated language, lack of summaries, unavailable in local languages), unsupportive auditing procedures, limited involvement of end-users in guideline development, and patchy training that may not filter back to all providers. Future aspirations identified include: improving the design features of guidelines, accessible places to find guidelines, making digitally-formatted versions available, more supplementary materials (e.g. posters) to support patient engagement, accessible clinical support following training, and in-facility training for all professional cadres to ensure fair access, similar levels of capability and interdisciplinary consistency. South African primary care nurses and allied health practitioners have high levels of motivation to use guidelines, but face many systemic barriers. We used the Behaviour Change Wheel to suggest relevant, implementable interventions addressing identified barriers. This theory-informed approach may improve clinical guideline implementation and impact healthcare for South Africa.",Health administration; Behavior change; Health informatics; Health care; Guideline; Medical education; Nursing research; Focus group; Medicine; Thematic analysis,Behaviour change; Clinical practice guidelines; Focus groups; Implementation; Primary care; Qualitative research; Quality improvement; Theoretical domains framework,"Allied Health Personnel/psychology; Delivery of Health Care/standards; Focus Groups; Guideline Adherence; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Motivation; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Primary Care Nursing/psychology; Primary Health Care/standards; Professional Practice/standards; Qualitative Research; Quality Improvement; Rural Health; South Africa",10.1186/s12913-018-3778-2,true

The United Kingdom adopts the National Health Service (NHS) Job Evaluation scheme to determine the pay bands for most NHS staff and ensure equal pay for work of equal value. The challenges of recruiting and retaining physicians in Chinese public hospitals have heightened the need for a reliable job evaluation system to ensure the equality of physician compensation. The aim of this study was to construct job evaluation factors of physicians in Chinese public hospitals based on the NHS Job Evaluation scheme and to examine the reliability and validity of the established system.; ; ; Methods ; Questionnaire surveys and statistical analyses were used to determine the job evaluation factors for physicians. The preliminary screening of the evaluation factors was based on a literature review, focused interviews with physicians and the Delphi method. Based on the results of preliminary screening, a questionnaire with 25 factors was designed to survey physicians regarding the importance of each factor in physician job evaluation. After the pretest, final questionnaire data were collected from 900 physicians by adopting a stratified sampling from 6 tertiary public hospitals in Beijing. A principal component analysis was used for factor extraction and structural validity analysis. The reliability was determined using Cronbach’s alpha.; ; ; Results ; The results of the principal component analysis showed that the 25 physician job evaluation factors were grouped into the 5 dimensions of Task Characteristics, Knowledge, Responsibility, Effort/Environment, and Skills. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of the five dimensions ranged from 0.841 to 0.909, which indicated a high level of reliability. The result of the factor analysis indicated fair structural validity. The content validity was established by building onto the NHS Job Evaluation scheme and other well-established job evaluation systems.; ; ; Conclusions ; Our study indicates that the Chinese version of physician job evaluation is an instrument with fair reliability and validity, which fully reflects the characteristics of physicians in Chinese public hospitals.

001-458-313-713-791,Rationing cancer treatment: a qualitative study of perceptions of legitimate limit-setting,2018,journal article,BMC health services research,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,United Kingdom,Eli Feiring; Hege Wang,"Governments are facing tough choices about whether to fund new, promising but highly expensive drugs within the public healthcare system. Decisions that some drugs are not sufficiently beneficial relative to their cost to merit public funding are often contentious. The importance of making decisions that stakeholders can understand and accept as legitimate is increasingly recognized and is commonly understood to be a crucial component for stakeholder support and successful implementation. Yet, little is known about clinicians’ perceptions of legitimate limit-setting. This study aimed to examine oncologists’ perceptions of the legitimacy of governmental decisions to deny patients access to new cancer drugs because effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the drugs has not been demonstrated. Semi-structured in-depth interviews with 12 Norwegian oncologists were carried out. Data were interpreted with the use of theory driven thematic analysis. The analytical framework of Accountability for reasonableness aided data gathering and interpretation. The participants endorsed the ideal of explicit criteria-based priority setting. Yet, when confronted with actual rationing decisions, they were far more equivocal. They advocated for increased access to drugs and were not always prepared to accept rationing of drugs they felt would benefit their patient. Distrust in the Norwegian centralised drug review process was found and different rationales were identified: i) Lack of engagement with the process, ii) Disagreement with the use of rationing criteria, iii) Lack of transparency and lack of dispute resolution procedures. Concerns about the wider implications of rationing decisions were reported. Most importantly, these related to negative impact on patient-doctor relationship of micro-level rationing and to inequities in drug availability resulting from privatisation of high-cost cancer treatment. Drawing on the analytical framework, we conclude that perceptions of legitimacy regarding rationing of high-cost drugs include procedural fairness. However, notions of substantive justice also seem to be important for accepting reasons given for decisions. Regulatory legitimacy may further warrant a more sophisticated theoretical account of second-order beliefs about the justifiability of rationing new technologies. These findings indicate a need for a broader concept of legitimacy than is commonly used in the literature on healthcare prioritisation.",Dispute resolution; Stakeholder; Justice (ethics); Rationing; Accountability; Distrust; Public relations; Legitimacy; Medicine; Thematic analysis,Cancer drugs; Clinicians; High-cost; Legitimacy; Norway; Priority-setting; Rationing; Thematic analysis,"Choice Behavior; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Making; Drug Costs; Female; Health Care Rationing; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Priorities; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Neoplasms/drug therapy; Norway; Physician-Patient Relations; Qualitative Research; Social Responsibility",10.1186/s12913-018-3137-3,true
001-693-803-506-138,Parental incarceration and children's oral health in the United States: Findings from the 2016-2018 National Survey of Children's Health.,2020,journal article,Community dentistry and oral epidemiology,Wiley,United Kingdom,Alexander Testa; Dylan B. Jackson,"Objective This study aimed to examine the association between parental incarceration and children's oral health in the United States and assess the degree to which household socioeconomic factors, children's healthcare insurance and oral healthcare utilization/preventive care explain this association. Methods Using data from the 2016-2018 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH; N = 99 962), a series of logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between parental incarceration and a variety of children's oral health conditions. The Karlson-Holm-Breen method was used to assess the degree to which household socioeconomic factors, children's healthcare insurance and oral healthcare utilization/preventive care visits reduced the association between parental incarceration and children's oral health. Results Results from logistic regression analyses demonstrated that net of control variables, children of incarcerated parents have significantly worse oral health including poor or fair teeth condition (OR = 2.71, 95% CI = 2.23-3.29), toothaches (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.36-2.18), gum bleeding (2.12, 95% CI = 1.52-2.94), cavities/tooth decay (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.26-1.77) and are more likely to have unmet dental care needs (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.28-2.46). Attenuation analyses demonstrated this relationship is partially explained by household material hardship and children's health insurance. Conclusions Parental incarceration is associated with worse oral health and unmet dental care needs. Household material hardship and children's health insurance partially attenuate this association. Efforts to expand oral health literacy to incarceration-exposed parents, and policies that buffer against material hardship and inadequacies in children's health insurance may be useful for improving oral health of children whose parents have been incarcerated.",Socioeconomic status; Logistic regression; Health care; Dental care; Early childhood caries; Health insurance; Oral health; Literacy; Medicine; Environmental health,early childhood caries; incarceration; oral health; parental incarceration; pediatric dentistry,Child; Child Health; Dental Caries/epidemiology; Humans; Oral Health; Parents; Socioeconomic Factors; United States/epidemiology,10.1111/cdoe.12588,false

The aim is to provide treatment for patients who otherwise would need hospitalisation. Currently there is a lack of studies investigating patient experiences in such services. The aims of this study were therefore to a) translate and validate the Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire (PPE-15) in Norwegian, and b) assess patient experiences in decentralised acute care, and potential factors associated with these experiences. Patients were recruited from five municipal acute wards in southeastern Norway during the period from June 2014 to June 2015. Data on socio-demographics, length of stay and comorbidity (Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)) were collected. Patients completed the Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire (PPE-15) and the EuroQOL 5-dimension, 3-level version. Convergent validity of the PPE-15 was assessed by correlation of items in PPE-15 and the Nordic Patient Experience Questionnaire (NORPEQ). A retest of the PPE-15 was performed in a subgroup of patients approximately 3 weeks after baseline assessment. Test-retest agreement was assessed with Cohens’ unweighted Kappa. A total of 479 patients responded, median age 78.0 years and 41.8% men. A total of 68 patients participated in the retest. Testing of convergent validity revealed an overall weak to moderate correlation. Kappa statistics showed from fair to good test-retest agreement. Most problems were related to continuity and transition, while fewest problems were related to respect for patient preferences. A higher Charlson comorbidity score was the only variable that was negatively associated with patient experience. Patients reported problems in several items of the PPE-15 after discharge from decentralised acute wards.

002-015-955-499-882,Excellence in continence care: an overview.,2016,journal article,British journal of nursing (Mark Allen Publishing),Mark Allen Group,United Kingdom,Paula Simpson,"established in 2012 to develop policies to address inequalities in the healthcare service. In November 2015, Excellence in continence care was published (NHS England, 2015a). This focuses on collaborative working in continence care with a view to achieving excellence, fairness and equality of care throughout England, and highlighting the need to listen to the requirements of service users. The aim of the publication is to give commissioning teams practical guidance on how to implement services for best care for their local population, in line with the five domains in Outcomes Framework 2015/2016 (NHS England, 2015b). Reviewing Excellence in continence care, it is evident that a clear pathway of care has been described to ensure that the provision and delivery of continence care are understood, and that predefined standards, with measurable outcomes, are achievable. Urinary incontinence is defined as any involuntary leakage of urine (Abrams et al, 2002) and faecal incontinence as the involuntary loss of liquid, gas or solid matter via the rectum (Norton et al, 2010). Excellence in continence care cites Buckley and Lapitans’ published data from 2009, which concluded that 14 million adults have bladder dysfunction and a further 6.5 million have bowel dysfunction in the UK. The data, although a number of years old, highlight the prevalence of the problem, which may be vastly underestimated, as many people feel uncomfortable seeking help because of embarrassment and stigma (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2007). The result is that many people suffer in silence (Bladder and Bowel Foundation, 2016). Continence should be regarded as a basic right for an individual, a belief championed by the Kent Continence Service, which states: ‘everyone has the right to be continent’ (Kent Community NHS Foundation Trust, 2015).

Baghlaf; Vanessa Muirhead; Paula Moynihan; S. Weston-Price; Cynthia Pine,"This systematic review aimed to assess the association between food and drink consumption around bedtime-specifically, food and drinks containing free sugars-and the risk of dental caries in children. Five electronic databases were searched (PubMed, Ovid Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus) to identify studies that investigated any relationship between food and drink around bedtime and dental caries in 3- to 16-y-old children. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality domain guidelines were used to assess the quality of the individual studies, while GRADE guidelines assessed the quality of studies based on the body of evidence. From 1,270 retrieved titles, 777 remained after removal of duplicates. Of these, 72 were reviewed in full. Eighteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis: 13 cross-sectional, 4 cohort, and 1 case-control. Studies were categorized into 3 age groups: 3- to 5-y-old, 6- to 11-y-old, and 12- to 16-y-old children. Based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality criteria, 6 of the 18 studies were rated as providing good-quality evidence; 8 were rated as fair; and 4 were categorized as being of poor quality. It was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis, because of the considerable variations in the type of bedtime exposure and outcome measures. The studies showed a consistent positive association across the 3 age groups, with all 7 studies on preschool children reporting significant positive associations. However, the quality of the body of evidence pertaining to the consumption of food and drinks at bedtime (specifically, food and drinks containing free sugars) and risk of caries was rated as ""very low."" The results suggest that restricting free sugars before and at bedtime may reduce the risk of caries, but studies with improved design are needed to confirm this. Knowledge Transfer Statement: This is the first systematic review of the evidence assessing the association between caries risk in children and the consumption of food or drinks at bedtime-specifically, foods and drinks containing free sugars. Although the data showed a consistent positive association, the quality of evidence was very low. This means that the current recommendation to restrict food and drinks containing free sugars before bedtime in children, while based on a sound physiologic premise, is supported only by very low-quality published evidence as measured by GRADE guidelines.",Consumption (economics); Cross-sectional study; Health care; Cohort study; Bedtime; Before Bedtime; Medicine; Cohort; Scopus; Environmental health,cariogenic diet; dental decay; food and drink; night snacks; schoolchildren; sucrose,"Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dental Caries; Dietary Sugars; Food; Humans; Sugars; Time Factors; United States",10.1177/2380084417749215,true

Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess awareness of the CDC birth cohort testing recommendation among adults born 1945-1965 who were managed at a single academic center's internal medicine clinics or by visiting a local health fair. Data were collected on respondents' demographics and HCV-related domains, including risk factors, awareness, data sources, prior testing, and interest in information about testing. Results There were a total of 563 respondents to the survey. Forty percent were aware of the CDC's testing recommendation, with Hispanic ethnicity being the only significant predictor (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.90). HCV testing rates were higher among those aware of the CDC's recommendation, as compared with those unaware (33.6% vs 24.0%, P = 0.0269). Television was the most common initial data source for the testing recommendation (64.8%), whereas healthcare providers accounted for 22.4%.

AFBS is an increasingly popular solution for delivering time-sensitive applications, extending network coverage, and assisting ground base stations in the healthcare systems for remote areas with limited infrastructure. Furthermore, the UAVs are deployed in the healthcare system to support the Internet of medical things (IoMT) devices in data collection, medical equipment distribution, and providing smart services. However, ensuring the privacy and security of patients' data with the limited UAV resources is a major challenge. In this paper, we present a federated deep reinforcement learning framework for resource allocation in UAV-enabled healthcare systems, where IoMT devices send their trained model parameters without transmitting sensitive raw data to the AMEC server. In the proposed framework, the IoMT device is associated with AFBS based on the quality of the data and its demand in order to maximize learning efficiency and accuracy. This work aims to minimize the computation costs of the IoMT devices while considering UAV resources and the fairness of UAV coverage.

In Canada, professional self-regulation is currently in decline as well, and while policy-makers have driven some change it is also the case that self-regulating professions have begun to transform themselves from within: altering their structure, make-up, and processes to enhance fairness, public input, and accountability, while reducing professional control. Why would they do so? This paper draws on the concept of institutional isomorphism to understand why professional regulators would invoke changes that, on the surface, might seem to counteract their own interests.

Perneger; Tenzin Wangmo; Bernice Simone Elger,"Introduction: Health research is gradually embracing a more collectivist approach, fueled by a new movement of open science, data sharing and collaborative partnerships. However, the existence of systemic contradictions hinders the sharing of health data and such collectivist endeavor. Therefore, this qualitative study explores these systemic barriers to a fair sharing of health data from the perspectives of Swiss stakeholders. Methods: Purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit 48 experts active in the Swiss healthcare domain, from the research/policy-making field and those having a high position in a health data enterprise (e.g., health register, hospital IT data infrastructure or a national health data initiative). Semi-structured interviews were then conducted, audio-recorded, verbatim transcribed with identifying information removed to guarantee the anonymity of participants. A theoretical thematic analysis was then carried out to identify themes and subthemes related to the topic of systemic fairness for sharing health data. Results: Two themes related to the topic of systemic fairness for sharing health data were identified, namely (i) the hypercompetitive environment and (ii) the legal uncertainty blocking data sharing. The theme, hypercompetitive environment was further divided into two subthemes, (i) systemic contradictions to fair data sharing and the (ii) need of fair systemic attribution mechanisms. Discussion: From the perspectives of Swiss stakeholders, hypercompetition in the Swiss academic system is hindering the sharing of health data for secondary research purposes, with the downside effect of influencing researchers to embrace individualism for career opportunities, thereby opposing the data sharing movement. In addition, there was a perceived sense of legal uncertainty from legislations governing the sharing of health data, which adds unreasonable burdens on individual researchers, who are often unequipped to deal with such facets of their data sharing activities.",Snowball sampling; Sociology; Health care; Secondary research; Qualitative research; Hypercompetition; Data sharing; Public relations; Health policy; Thematic analysis,attribution mechanisms; data sharing; health data; health policy; legislation; systemic fairness,Hospitals; Humans; Policy Making; Qualitative Research; Research Personnel; Switzerland,10.3389/fpubh.2021.669463,true

Sathianathen; Jacob Albersheim-Carter; Lucas Labine; Brett Watson; Badrinath R. Konety; Christopher J. Weight,"OBJECTIVE To determine how the general public interprets surgical complication rates presented from a publicly available online surgical-rating website. SUBJECTS AND METHODS An in-person electronic survey was administered at the local State Fair to a convenience sample. Participants were presented with a representative output from an online surgeon-rating website and were asked to choose from three statistically equivalent surgeons for a hypothetical medical decision. We then suggested that their insurance company would only cover one surgeon and probed their willingness to pay to switch surgeons for a small chance of lowering the risk of a complication (0.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -8.1% to 9.5%, P = 0.9). We quantified the characteristics of those willing to switch, the degree of misinterpretation, and the subsequent potential patient harms. RESULTS There were 343 completed responses. When presented with a hypothetical healthcare decision, most participants (n = 209, 61%) said they were willing to pay out-of-pocket expenses to switch to a statistically equivalent surgeon. Those who were willing to pay to switch surgeons were more likely to be older (odds ratio [OR] 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), poorer (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.07-3.11), previously had cancer (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.9-25), and misinterpreted the data (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.87-4.96). Those who were willing to pay out-of-pocket expenses were more inaccurate in their estimation of surgeon complication rates (mean estimate 34.0% vs 8.9%, P < 0.001, correct rate = 3.6%), and on average were willing to pay $6 494 (95% CI 4 108-8 880).

We sought to compare the sonographic characteristics (thyroid imaging reporting and data system [Ti-RADS] classification) with the reported cytological results (Bethesda categories) from thyroid nodules in young recruits and examine the efficiency of our unique multidisciplinary clinic. Materials and methods In this retrospective cohort, we identified young recruits (18-25 years) who underwent needle biopsies for asymptomatic thyroid nodule(s), with cytology reports of Bethesda categories II-V, performed in our ""Rapid Diagnostic Service"" at a large Israeli Defense Forces Medical Corps healthcare facility, between 2013 and 2018. We studied the concordance rates between their Ti-RADS and Bethesda grades, and the preoperative Bethesda grades accuracy versus final pathology results, and the time period needed for their thyroid nodules workup. Results A total of 81 patients were included who contributed 91 nodules. A fair agreement was found between the Ti-RADS classifications and the Bethesda grades (Cohen's κ = 0.238) that was more noticeable in males than in females. The agreement rate was 87.5% in males (21 of 24), but only 77.6% in females (59 of 67) [P = .029]. Of the 5 operated benign cases, all had low Ti-RADS, and 2 had low Bethesda. Of the 8 operated malignant cases, 6 had high Ti-RADS, and 5 had high Bethesda. On average, 37.64 days elapsed between the first visit to the ultrasound study, and 24.2 days elapsed until biopsy was performed.

Harris,"Background Healthcare-associated infections such as surgical site infections (SSIs) are used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as pay-for-performance metrics. Risk adjustment allows a fairer comparison of SSI rates across hospitals. Until 2016, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) risk adjustment models for pay-for-performance SSI did not adjust for patient comorbidities. New 2016 CDC models only adjust for body mass index and diabetes. Methods We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing surgical procedures at 28 US hospitals. Demographic data and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes were obtained on patients undergoing colectomy, hysterectomy, and knee and hip replacement procedures. Complex SSIs were identified by infection preventionists at each hospital using CDC criteria. Model performance was evaluated using measures of discrimination and calibration. Hospitals were ranked by SSI proportion and risk-adjusted standardized infection ratios (SIR) to assess the impact of comorbidity adjustment on public reporting. Results Of 45394 patients at 28 hospitals, 573 (1.3%) developed a complex SSI. A model containing procedure type, age, race, smoking, diabetes, liver disease, obesity, renal failure, and malnutrition showed good discrimination (C-statistic, 0.73) and calibration. When comparing hospital rankings by crude proportion to risk-adjusted ranks, 24 of 28 (86%) hospitals changed ranks, 16 (57%) changed by ≥2 ranks, and 4 (14%) changed by >10 ranks.

As part of the ERNs, the Clinical Patient Management System, CPMS, a secure digital platform, was developed to allow and facilitate web-based, clinical consultations between submitting clinicians and relevant international experts. The European Reference Network on Intellectual Disability, TeleHealth and Congenital Anomalies, ERN ITHACA, was formed to harness the clinical and diagnostic expertise in the sector of rare, multiple anomaly and/or intellectual disability syndromes, chromosome disorders and undiagnosed syndromic disorders. We present the first year results of CPMS use by ERN ITHACA as an example of a telemedicine strategy for the diagnosis and management of patients with rare developmental disorders. ERN ITHACA ranked third in telemedicine activity amongst 24 European networks after 12 months of using the CPMS. Information about 28 very rare cases from 13 different centres across 7 countries was shared on the platform, with diagnostic or other management queries. Early interaction with patient support groups identified data protection as of primary importance in adopting digital platforms for patient diagnosis and care. The first launch of the CPMS was built to accommodate the needs of all ERNs. The ERN ITHACA telemedicine process highlighted a need to customise the CPMS with network-specific requirements. The results of this effort should enhance the CPMS utility for telemedicine services and ERN-specific care outcomes. We present the results of a long and fruitful process of interaction between the ERN ITHACA network lead team and EU officials, software developers and members of 38 EU clinical genetics centres to organise and coordinate direct e-healthcare through a secure, digital platform. The variability of the queries in just the first 28 cases submitted to the ERN ITHACA CPMS is a fair representation of the complexity and rarity of the patients referred, but also proof of the sophisticated and variable service that could be provided through a structured telemedicine approach for patients and families with rare developmental disorders.

It has been argued that AI is experiencing a fast process of commodification. This characterization correctly reflects the current process of industrialization of AI and its reach into society. Therefore, societal issues related to the use of AI and ML should not be ignored any longer and certainly not in the medical domain. These societal issues may take many forms, but they all entail the design of models from a human-centred perspective, incorporating human-relevant requirements and constraints. In this brief paper, we discuss a number of specific issues affecting the use of AI and ML in medicine, such as fairness, privacy and anonymity, explainability and interpretability, but also some broader societal issues, such as ethics and legislation. We reckon that all of these are relevant aspects to consider in order to achieve the objective of fostering acceptance of AI- and ML-based technologies, as well as to comply with an evolving legislation concerning the impact of digital technologies on ethically and privacy sensitive matters. Our specific goal here is to reflect on how all these topics affect medical applications of AI and ML. This paper includes some of the contents of the “2nd Meeting of Science and Dialysis: Artificial Intelligence,” organized in the Bellvitge University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain. Summary and Key Messages: AI and ML are attracting much interest from the medical community as key approaches to knowledge extraction from data.

Public and private actors have been investing significant amounts of resources into the field. However, to benefit from data-intensive medicine, particularly from AI technologies, one must first and foremost have access to data. It has been previously argued that the conventionally used ""consent or anonymize approach"" undermines data-intensive medicine, and worse, may ultimately harm patients. Yet, this is still a dominant approach in European countries and framed as an either-or choice. In this paper, we contrast the different data governance approaches in the EU and their advantages and disadvantages in the context of healthcare AI. We detail the ethical trade-offs inherent to data-intensive medicine, particularly the balancing of data privacy and data access, and the subsequent prioritization between AI and other effective health interventions. If countries wish to allocate resources to AI, they also need to make corresponding efforts to improve (secure) data access. We conclude that it is unethical to invest significant amounts of public funds into AI development whilst at the same time limiting data access through strict privacy measures, as this constitutes a waste of public resources. The ""AI revolution"" in healthcare can only realise its full potential if a fair, inclusive engagement process spells out the values underlying (trans) national data governance policies and their impact on AI development, and priorities are set accordingly.",Data governance; Context (archaeology); Internet privacy; Health care; Harm; Data Protection Act 1998; Corporate governance; Data access; Information privacy; General Data Protection Regulation; Big data; Computer science; Business; Computer security; Public relations; Data quality; Political science; Law; Marketing; Paleontology; Metric (unit); Finance; Biology; Programming language; Operating system,artificial intelligence; data access; data privacy; digital health; ethics; fairness; resource allocation,,10.3389/fgene.2022.929453,true

Gabriel; Lucila Ohno-Machado,"Author(s): Kuo, Tsung-Ting; Gabriel, Rodney A; Ohno-Machado, Lucila | Abstract: ObjectiveDecentralized privacy-preserving predictive modeling enables multiple institutions to learn a more generalizable model on healthcare or genomic data by sharing the partially trained models instead of patient-level data, while avoiding risks such as single point of control. State-of-the-art blockchain-based methods remove the ""server"" role but can be less accurate than models that rely on a server. Therefore, we aim at developing a general model sharing framework to preserve predictive correctness, mitigate the risks of a centralized architecture, and compute the models in a fair way.Materials and methodsWe propose a framework that includes both server and ""client"" roles to preserve correctness. We adopt a blockchain network to obtain the benefits of decentralization, by alternating the roles for each site to ensure computational fairness. Also, we developed GloreChain (Grid Binary LOgistic REgression on Permissioned BlockChain) as a concrete example, and compared it to a centralized algorithm on 3 healthcare or genomic datasets to evaluate predictive correctness, number of learning iterations and execution time.ResultsGloreChain performs exactly the same as the centralized method in terms of correctness and number of iterations. It inherits the advantages of blockchain, at the cost of increased time to reach a consensus model.DiscussionOur framework is general or flexible and can also address intrinsic challenges of blockchain networks.

007-380-384-335-688,D-BIAS: A Causality-Based Human-in-the-Loop System for Tackling Algorithmic Bias.,2022,journal article,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),United States,Bhavya Ghai; Klaus Mueller,"With the rise of AI, algorithms have become better at learning underlying patterns from the training data including ingrained social biases based on gender, race, etc. Deployment of such algorithms to domains such as hiring, healthcare, law enforcement, etc. has raised serious concerns about fairness, accountability, trust and interpretability in machine learning algorithms. To alleviate this problem, we propose D-BIAS, a visual interactive tool that embodies human-in-the-loop AI approach for auditing and mitigating social biases from tabular datasets. It uses a graphical causal model to represent causal relationships among different features in the dataset and as a medium to inject domain knowledge. A user can detect the presence of bias against a group, say females, or a subgroup, say black females, by identifying unfair causal relationships in the causal network and using an array of fairness metrics. Thereafter, the user can mitigate bias by refining the causal model and acting on the unfair causal edges. For each interaction, say weakening/deleting a biased causal edge, the system uses a novel method to simulate a new (debiased) dataset based on the current causal model while ensuring a minimal change from the original dataset. Users can visually assess the impact of their interactions on different fairness metrics, utility metrics, data distortion, and the underlying data distribution. Once satisfied, they can download the debiased dataset and use it for any downstream application for fairer predictions. We evaluate D-BIAS by conducting experiments on 3 datasets and also a formal user study. We found that D-BIAS helps reduce bias significantly compared to the baseline debiasing approach across different fairness metrics while incurring little data distortion and a small loss in utility. Moreover, our human-in-the-loop based approach significantly outperforms an automated approach on trust, interpretability and accountability.",Interpretability; Computer science; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Human-in-the-loop; Causal structure; Causal model; Data mining; Causality (physics); Medicine; Physics; Pathology; Quantum mechanics,,,10.1109/tvcg.2022.3209484,true

This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice related to malaria diagnosis for early detection among healthcare workers in the laboratories of hospitals in Thailand. The design of the study was a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out between January 2016 and March 2017 at 11 hospitals in Thailand. The interviewees included any scientists who were currently working in a medical laboratory. Mean scores for knowledge, attitude, and practice for each healthcare group were calculated and compared between groups. Data analysis was performed using the SPSS version 11.5 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Among a total of 118 healthcare workers, most of the healthcare workers had fair to good knowledge, attitude, and practice related to malaria detection. Among the various positions of healthcare workers, medical technologists possessed a greater knowledge on malaria detection than medical technician assistants or laboratory assistants (X2 = 9.822, d.f. = 2, and P value=0.007). This study infers that knowledge, attitude, and practice related to malaria detection among healthcare workers in laboratories were adequate. However, some points of knowledge and practice must be updated. There is a very urgent need to update knowledge on malaria, especially about the number of Plasmodium species causing relapse in malaria patients. In addition, there is an urgent need to update the practice related to malaria detection, especially about the staining process for early detection of malaria.",Cross-sectional study; Health care; Technician; Malaria; MEDLINE; Plasmodium species; Early detection; Medical laboratory; Family medicine; Medicine,,,10.1155/2019/1414079,true

Haas; Anagha Alka Tolpadi; Marc N. Elliott; Joan M. Teno; Alan M. Zaslavsky; Rebecca Anhang Price,"Abstract Context The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS®) Hospice Survey assesses the care experiences of hospice patients and their families. Public reporting of hospice performance on these survey measures began in February 2018. Objectives Develop an appropriate case-mix adjustment (CMA) model to allow for fair comparisons between hospices. Methods We analyzed CAHPS Hospice Survey data reflecting experiences of 915,442 patients who received care from 2513 hospice programs between April 2015 and March 2016. Decedent and caregiver characteristics were identified for inclusion in CMA based on their variation across hospices (as measured by intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs]) and how predictive they were of responses to survey questions (as assessed by linear regression). Results The final CMA model included decedent age, payer for hospice care, primary diagnosis, length of final episode of hospice care, caregiver age, caregiver education, relationship to decedent, survey language/language spoken at home, and response percentile. The characteristics that varied most across hospices were language (ICC = 0.48 for Spanish survey or home language) and payer for hospice care (ICC = 0.42 for Medicare only; ICC = 0.35 for Medicare and private insurance). The characteristics that were most predictive of caregivers' survey responses were payer for hospice care, caregiver education, and survey language/language spoken at home. Lack of appropriate adjustment would incorrectly rank hospices by 1.2–5.4 percentile points.

This study explores perceptions of openness in England before and after the publication of the Francis report (2013), which examined failings of openness at one English hospital. We examine whether staff and patients’ views on openness, and experiences of giving voice to concerns, have changed since the report’s publication for better or worse. Organisational-level data was collated for all trusts from the NHS National Staff Survey (2007–2017), NHS Acute Inpatient Survey (2004–2016) and NHS Community Mental Health Service User Survey (2007–2017). Survey items related to openness were identified and longitudinal statistical analysis conducted (piecewise growth curve and interrupted latent growth curve analysis) to determine whether there was evidence of a shift in the rate or direction of change following publication of the Francis report. For some variables there was a discernible change in trajectory after the publication of the Francis report. Staff survey variables continued to rise after 2013, with a statistically significant increase in rate for “fairness and effectiveness of incident reporting procedures” (from + 0.02 to + 0.06 per year; p < .001). For the patient surveys, the picture was more mixed: patient views about information provided by accident and emergency staff rose from a 0.3% increase per year before 2013 to 0.8% per year afterwards (p < .01), and inpatients being involved in decision making increased from a 0.4% rise per year before 2013 to 0.8% per year afterwards (p < .01); however, there were not rises in the other questions. Mental health patients reported a decrease after 2013 in being listened to (decreasing at a rate of 1.9% per year, p < .001). Data suggest that the Francis inquiry may have had a positive impact on staff and acute inpatients’ perceptions and experiences of openness in the NHS. However such improvements have not transpired in mental health.

This study aims to describe to what extent sexual rights of young migrants in Sweden are being fulfilled. METHODS A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 1773 young (16-29 years) migrants by post, online, and at language schools and other venues. Sexual rights were operationalised and categorised into five domains adapted from the Guttmacher-Lancet Commission's definition. These domains included the right to: 1) access sexual and reproductive healthcare, 2) access information and education about sexuality and sexual and reproductive health and rights, 3) have bodily integrity, 4) make free informed decisions about sexuality and sexual relations and 5) have a satisfying and safe sexual life. Descriptive analysis was used to assess the extent of fulfilment for each right. RESULTS There were wide variations in the fulfilment of sexual rights between subgroups and among the five domains. Most respondents rated their sexual health as good/fair, however, 6.3% rated their sexual health as bad/very bad. While most of those who visited related services were satisfied, 17.4% of respondents refrained from visiting the services despite their needs. Around four in ten respondents did not know where to get information about sexuality and sexual health. One-fourth of respondents reported sexual violence. Another 12.7% were limited by family members or fellow countrymen regarding with whom they can have an intimate relationship. Most respondents were satisfied with their sexual life, except for 11.9%. Men, non-binary respondents, lesbians, gays, bisexuals, asexuals, those who were awaiting a decision regarding residence permit and those born in South Asia reported poor sexual health to a greater extent and fulfilment of their sexual rights to a lesser extent than other groups. CONCLUSIONS Timely and culturally adapted information about sexual rights, gender equalities, laws and available services in Sweden should be provided in appropriate languages and formats in order to raise awareness about sexual rights and improve access to available services.

While the rates of hypertension awareness, treatment, and control in India have been reported in several studies, the factors associated with these rates are less well-understood. Existing studies are predominantly cross-sectional, and the factors examined are limited. Understanding the predictors associated with these rates, using more rigorous study designs, is crucial for the development of strategies to improve hypertension management.; ; Aims: To examine a range of factors associated with hypertension awareness, treatment, and control using both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.; ; Methods: Data was derived from a population-based sample of 1,710 participants from Kerala, aged 30–60 years. We examined a comprehensive range of factors, including demographic, behavioral factors, anthropometric, clinical measures, psychosocial factors and healthcare utilization. Multilevel mixed effects logistic regression was used for both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses (repeated measures for all variables across 2 years) to determine the factors associated with awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension.; ; Results: A total of 467 (27.3%) participants had hypertension at baseline. Among those, the rates of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension were 54.4, 25.5, and 36.4%, respectively. Being male (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14–0.53) and consumption of alcohol (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31–0.80) were significant predictors of poorly controlled hypertension (longitudinal analysis). Depression (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.15–3.61) and fair-to-poor self-perceived health status (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.15–3.04) were associated with increased hypertension awareness, whereas anxiety (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.04–3.71) was associated with increased hypertension treatment (cross-sectional analysis).

Such learning healthcare models have generated ethical debate in high-income countries, including on the role of patient and public consent and engagement. Increasing use of electronic health records in low-middle income countries offers important potential to fast-track healthcare improvements in these settings, where a disproportionate burden of global morbidity occurs. Core ethical issues have been raised around the role and form of information sharing processes for learning healthcare systems, including individual consent and individual and public general notification processes, but little research has focused on this perspective in low-middle income countries. We conducted a qualitative study on the role of information sharing and governance processes for inpatient data re-use, using in-depth interviews with 34 health stakeholders at two public hospitals on the Kenyan coast, including health managers, providers and researchers. Data were collected between March and July 2016 and analysed using a framework approach, with Nvivo 10 software to support data management. Most forms of clinical data re-use were seen as an important public health good. Individual consent and general notification processes were often argued as important, but contingent on interrelated influences of the type of data, use and secondary user. Underlying concerns were linked to issues of patient privacy and autonomy; perceived risks to trust in health systems; and fairness in how data would be used, particularly for non-public sector re-users. Support for engagement often turned on the anticipated outcomes of information-sharing processes, as building or undermining trust in healthcare systems. As reported in high income countries, learning healthcare systems in low-middle counties may generate a core ethical tension between supporting a public good and respecting patient autonomy and privacy, with the maintenance of public trust acting as a core requirement. While more evidence is needed on patient and public perspectives on learning healthcare activities, greater collaboration between public health and research governance systems is likely to support the development of efficient and locally responsive learning healthcare activities in LMICs.",Philosophy of medicine; Public health; Business; Health care; Public good; Qualitative research; Stakeholder; Information sharing; Public trust; Public relations,Acceptability; Africa; Comparative effectiveness research; Electronic health records; General notification; Informed consent; Kenya; Learning healthcare systems; Public engagement; Quality improvement research; Trust,"Comparative Effectiveness Research; Data Anonymization/ethics; Delivery of Health Care/ethics; Electronic Health Records; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; Informed Consent/ethics; Interviews as Topic; Kenya; Pilot Projects; Privacy; Public Health/ethics; Qualitative Research; Quality Improvement/ethics; Social Responsibility; Stakeholder Participation",10.1186/s12910-018-0343-9,true

Psychoeducational intervention (PEI) has been highlighted as a promising symptom intervention, but the effect of PEI in the management of cancer symptom clusters remains unknown. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of PEI on managing symptom clusters in patients with cancer. METHODS Six databases were searched, together with hand searching, to identify eligible randomized controlled trials from the year 2001 to July 2014. Data selection, quality appraisal of studies, and data extraction were conducted independently by 2 reviewers. Data were synthesized by use of a systematic narrative approach, and meta-analysis was conducted when this was possible. RESULTS Four eligible studies involving 343 cancer patients were included in the review. The methodological quality of the studies was generally fair. Symptom clusters seemed to improve with the provision of PEI. Meta-analysis shows significant improvement in functional performance. CONCLUSIONS The evidence that PEI could alleviate cancer symptom clusters is encouraging but inconclusive in this review. Future well-designed investigations testing some commonly used PEI such as progressive muscle relaxation and patient education on various types of cancer symptom clusters are warranted.

One solution for most of these challenges are Distributed Analytics (DA) infrastructures, which are technologies fostering collaborations between healthcare institutions by establishing a privacy-preserving network for data sharing. However, in order to participate in such a network, a lot of technical and administrative prerequisites have to be made, which could pose bottlenecks and new obstacles for non-technical personnel during their deployment. We have identified three major problems in the current state-of-the-art. Namely, the missing compliance with FAIR data principles, the automation of processes, and the installation. In this work, we present a seamless on-boarding workflow based on a DA reference architecture for data sharing institutions to address these problems. The on-boarding service manages all technical configurations and necessities to reduce the deployment time. Our aim is to use well-established and conventional technologies to gain acceptance through enhanced ease of use. We evaluate our development with six institutions across Germany by conducting a DA study with open-source breast cancer data, which represents the second contribution of this work. We find that our on-boarding solution lowers technical barriers and efficiently deploys all necessary components and is, therefore, indeed an enabler for collaborative data sharing.</jats:p>",Workflow; Software deployment; Enabling; Computer science; Analytics; Data sharing; Cloud computing; Service (business); Computer security; Data science; Knowledge management; Business; Database; Software engineering; Medicine; Psychology; Alternative medicine; Pathology; Marketing; Psychotherapist; Operating system,,,10.3390/app12094336,true

Ethiopia is one of the 30 high TB burden countries. TB causes burden in healthcare system and challenge the effectiveness of HIV care. This study was to assess incidence and predictors of Tuberculosis among adults on antiretroviral therapy at Debre Markos Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, 2019. Institution based retrospective follow up study was conducted among adults on ART newly enrolled from 2014 to 2018 at Debre Markos Referral Hospital. Simple random sampling technique was used to select patients chart. Data was entered to EPI- INFO version 7.2.2.6 and analyzed using Stata 14.0. Tuberculosis incidence rate was computed and described using frequency tables. Both bivariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models was fitted to identify predictors of TB. Out of the 536 patients chart reviewed, 494 patient records were included in the analysis. A total of 62 patients developed new TB cases during the follow up period of 1000.22 Person Years (PY); which gives an overall incidence rate of 6.19 cases per 100 PY (95% CI: 4.83–7.95). The highest rate was seen within the first year of follow up.

The purpose of the article is to seek guidelines for the siting of healthcare facilities to provide suitable and equal healthcare to different social structures, and for the optimal and fair spatial distribution of healthcare services. The descriptive method was used to review literature on the siting of healthcare facilities based on the purpose of their operation, demographic changes, environmental characteristics, and the impact on public health. This method was selected as it facilitates data acquisition from various sources and a comprehensive understanding of the topic discussed. The results of the research show how important the impact of the healthcare care facilities siting on human health and the wider social significance of the topic discussed is.

009-741-595-570-542,6 Adding evidence of the effects of treatments into relevant wikipedia pages: a randomised trial,2022,conference proceedings article,Abstracts,BMJ Publishing Group Ltd,,Umer Siddique; Clive Adams; Mohsin Hussein; Alan Montgomery; Tony Aburrow; Sophie Bloomfield; Paul Briley; Ebun Carew; Suravi Chatterjee-Woolman; Ghalia Feddah; Johannes Friedel; Josh Gibbard; Euan Haynes; Mahesh Jayaram; Samuel Naylor; Luke Perry; Lena Schmidt; Ayla Tabaksert; Douglas Taylor; Aarti Velani; Douglas White; Jun Xia,"<h3>Background</h3> Wikipedia is among the most popular sites on the internet, and around a fifth of all healthcare searches online directs to a Wikipedia page. In recent years steps have been taken to enhance the quality of their healthcare pages, such as the creation of the WikiProject Medicine initiative. In 2014 a partnership was formalised between Wikipedia and Cochrane Collaboration with similar aims. Three years ago, a group of medical students helped to formulate a protocol for the first ever randomised trial, whose aim was to test the value of Wikipedia in informing users about healthcare. <h3>Objectives</h3> To investigate the effects of adding high-grade quantitative evidence of outcomes of treatments into relevant Wikipedia pages on further information-seeking behaviour by the end-user. Methods: We randomised 70 Wikipedia pages, identified as highly relevant to up-to-date Cochrane Schizophrenia systematic reviews that contained a Summary of Findings table. Eligible Wikipedia pages in the intervention group (35) were seeded with tables listing best evidence of the effects of treatment, and hyperlinks to the source Cochrane review. Eligible pages in the control group (35) remained unchanged. <h3>Results</h3> The main outcome measures were routinely collected data on access to the full text and summary web page of the relevant Cochrane reviews (after 12 months). There was 100% follow-up of the 70 randomised pages. Six of the 35 in the intervention group had the tabular format deleted by other Wikipedia users during the course of the study, but all pages continued to report the same data within the text. The study found no evidence of significant effect on either of the co-primary outcomes: full text access adjusted ratio of geometric means 1.30, 95% CI: 0.71 to 2.38; page views 1.14, 95% CI: 0.6 to 2.13. Results were similar for all other outcomes, with the exception of Altmetric score for which there was evidence of clear effect (1.36, 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.78). <h3>Conclusions</h3> The pursuit of fair balance within Wikipedia healthcare pages is impressive and its reach unsurpassed. Enriching Wikipedia content is, potentially, a powerful way to improve health literacy among the public, and it is possible to test the effects of seeding pages with evidence. Though increased traffic to Cochrane reviews in the intervention group lacked statistical significance, there was nonetheless consistently an increase in all outcome measures. For every person that sought and clicked the reference on the 9intervention9 Wikipedia page to seek more information (the primary outcome), many more are likely to have been informed by the page alone; the inclusion of high-quality data may have lessened the desire to click out to the original source. If demonstrated that the end-user becomes more informed as a result of such intervention, the potential as a tool for dissemination could be invaluable. Future studies should take such factors into consideration, and aim to replicate, expand and further develop our trial.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate county hospitals efficiency before and after the healthcare reform, and further assess the reform effectiveness through the comparative analysis of the efficiency. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was employed to calculate the efficiency of 1105 sample hospitals which were selected from 31 provinces of China, also, Tobit regression was used to regress against those main external environmental factors. Our results show that the scales and amounts of service of hospitals had increased sharply, however, the efficiency was relatively low and decreased slightly from 2008 to 2012. Thirteen (1.18%) in 2008 and six (0.54%) hospitals in 2012 were defined as technically efficient, and the average scores were 0.2916 and 0.2503. The technical efficiency average score of the post-reform was significantly less than that of the pre-reform (p < 0.001), and the score of eastern region was highest and the western was lowest among three regions of China. It suggests the reform had not well improved county hospital efficiency although hospitals have reached a fair developing scale, and the corresponding policies and measures should be put into effect for improving efficiency, especially in the level and structure of health investment, operation and supervision mechanism of county hospitals.",Health administration; Public health; Health care; Tobit model; China; Data envelopment analysis; Health care reform; Socioeconomics; Scale (social sciences); Medicine,China; County hospital efficiency; Data envelopment approach; Healthcare reform,"China; Databases, Factual; Efficiency, Organizational/statistics & numerical data; Health Care Reform; Hospitals, County; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Regression Analysis",10.1186/s12913-017-2780-4,true

These non-commercial trials are often hampered by underfunding, which may lead to difficulties in gathering a team with the necessary expertise, a delayed trial start, slow recruitment and even early trial discontinuation. As a new public funder of pragmatic clinical trials, the KCE Trials programme was committed to correctly pay all trial activities in order to assure timely delivery of high-quality trial results. As no appropriate trial budget tool was readily publicly available that took into account the costs for the sponsor as well as the costs for participating sites, we developed a tool to make the budgeting of a clinical trial efficient, transparent and fair across applicants. All trial-related activities of the sponsor and sites were categorised, and cost drivers were identified. All elements were included in a spreadsheet tool allowing the sponsor team to calculate in detail the various activities of a clinical trial and to appreciate the budget impact of specific cost drivers, e.g. a delay in recruitment. Hourly fees by role were adapted from published data. Fixed amounts per activity were developed when appropriate. This publicly available tool has already been used for 17 trials funded since the start of the KCE Trials programme in 2016, and it continues to be used and improved. This budget tool is used together with additional risk-reducing measures such as a multistep selection process with advance payments, a recruitment feasibility check by sponsor and funder, a close monitoring of study progress and a milestone-based payment schedule with the last payment made when the manuscript is submitted. The budget tool helps the KCE Trials programme to answer relevant research questions in a timely way, within budget and with high quality, a necessary condition to achieve impact of this programme for patients, clinical practice and healthcare payers.",Milestone (project management); Payment; Health care; Operations management; Psychological intervention; Payment schedule; Quality (business); Clinical trial; Medicine; Cost driver,Clinical trial costs; Clinical trials; Cost drivers  pragmatic; Non-commercial; Public funding; Resource use,"Budgets; Cost Savings; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Financing, Government/economics; Humans; Models, Economic; Multicenter Studies as Topic/economics; Public Sector/economics; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/economics; Research Design; Research Support as Topic/economics",10.1186/s13063-019-3900-8,true

Alhraiwil,"Background Premarital screening and genetic counseling (PMSGC) is compulsory in Saudi Arabia and aims to identify and decrease the prevalence of some genetic and sexually transmitted infectious diseases. However, there are little data on community awareness about PMSGC. This study assessed knowledge levels, attitudes, and behaviors associated with PMSGC in the general Saudi Arabian population and their associations with sociodemographic characteristics. Methods This was a cross-sectional, population-based study of 6263 participants randomly selected from all 20 health regions in Saudi Arabia, stratified according to age and fulfilling predefined selection criteria. Trained data collectors used a comprehensive pretested questionnaire to collect data. Data were collected in March and April 2019. Univariable and multivariable associations between sociodemographic characteristics and knowledge levels, attitudes, and behaviors were examined. Results While all 6263 study participants had heard about PMSGC, only 575 (9.2%) participants had satisfactory knowledge, while 3283 (52.4%) participants had fair knowledge. Predictors of high knowledge scores were university or higher education level (aOR=2.06; 95% CI: 1.80-2.36), positive medical history of PMSGC-screened disease (aOR=2.02; 95% CI: 1.51-2.69), family income ≥3000 SR/month (aOR=1.70; 95% CI: 1.50-1.93), being married/previously married (aOR=1.46; 95% CI: 1.25-1.70), female gender (aOR=1.25; 95% CI: 1.12-1.40), and age >18 years (aOR=1.25; 95% CI: 1.06-1.48). The majority of participants (5246, 83.8%) had positive attitudes towards the importance of PMSGC, the burden of screened genetic and infectious diseases on the family, and that marrying was inadvisable with incompatible results. Of the 3986 engaged or married participants, 2911 (73.0%) had undertaken premarital screening, of whom 360 (12.4%) had incompatible results; 98 (37.1%) married despite this information. Conclusion Despite advances in public healthcare measures in Saudi Arabia, gaps remain in the knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors associated with PMSGC. Culturally specific community health education programs for PMSGC must be devised that emphasize the risks associated with consanguineous marriage.",Demography; Medical history; Community health; Family income; Disease; Consanguinity; Population; Consanguineous Marriage; Medicine; Genetic counseling,Saudi Arabia; consanguinity; genetic counseling; premarital; screening,,10.2147/jmdh.s296221,true

Properly staffed and fairly distributed primary health care (PHC) facilities are prerequisites to ensure accessible healthcare services. Nevertheless, availability and accessibility issues are common public health concerns, especially in under-resourced countries including Ethiopia. Measuring inequalities in accessibility of healthcare resources guide policy decisions to improve PHC services and ultimately achieving universal health coverage (UHC). Purpose To assess availability and measure magnitude and trend of inequalities in accessibility of health centre-based PHC resources in Ethiopia during 2015 to 2017. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional population-based analysis of district-level data collected from 16th December 2017 until 24th May 2018. Afar, Dire-Dawa, and Tigray regions were purposefully included in the study to represent the four pastoralist/semi-pastoralist, three urban and four agrarian regions in Ethiopia, respectively. We used ratios, different inequality indices and Gini decomposition techniques to characterise the inequalities. Results In 2017, median of health centres (HCs) per 15,000 inhabitants and their Gini indices (GIs) for Afar, Dire-Dawa, and Tigray were 0.781, 0.566, 0.591 vs. 0.237, 0.280, 0.216 respectively. Median overall skilled health workers (SHWs) per 10,000 inhabitants were 5.250, 7.539, and 6.246, respectively. These accounted for 11.80%, 16.94% and 14.04% of the WHO target of 44.5 to achieve SDGs. The corresponding GIs for the regions were 0.347, 0.186 and 0.175. Despite a higher overall SHWs inequality in the urban districts of Tigray (GI = 0.301), only Tigray showed significant inequality reductions in GHE (p < 0.001) and in all categories of SHWs (p < 0.05). Conclusions Our analysis provided a clear picture of availability and inequalities in PHC resources across three regions in Ethiopia. Identifying contributing factors to low densities and high inequalities of SHWs may help improve PHC services nationwide, along with pathway towards UHC.",Public policy; Public health; Health care; Pastoralism; Geography; Population health; Population; Socioeconomics; Inequality; Health economics,,Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethiopia; Female; Health Resources; Health Services Accessibility/statistics & numerical data; Healthcare Disparities/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Male; Pregnancy; Primary Health Care/statistics & numerical data; Public Health; Public Policy; Universal Health Insurance,10.1371/journal.pone.0213896,true

This review evaluated the usability of EMR systems implemented in sub-Saharan Africa based on a usability evaluation criterion developed by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS). Objective: This review aimed to evaluate EMR system implementations in sub-Saharan Africa against a well-defined evaluation methodology and assess their usability based on a defined set of metrics. In addition, the review aimed to identify the extent to which usability has been an enabling or hindering factor in the implementation of EMR systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Five key metrics for evaluating EMR system usability were developed based on the methodology proposed by HIMSS. These were efficiency, effectiveness, ease of learning, cognitive load, and user satisfaction. A 5-point rating system was developed for the review. EMR systems in 19 reviewed publications were scored based on this rating system. It awarded 5 points per metric to any EMR system that was identified as excellent, 4 points for good, 3 points for fair, 2 points for poor, and 1 point for bad. In addition, each of the 5 key metrics carried a maximum weighted score of 20. The percentage scores for each metric were then computed from the weighted scores from which the final overall usability score was derived. Results: In possibly contributing to the usability of implemented EMR systems, ease of learning obtained the highest percentage score of 71% (SD 1.09) followed by cognitive load in second place with a score of 68% (SD 1.62). Effectiveness followed closely in third place at 67% (SD 1.47) and efficiency was in fourth place at 64% (SD 1.04). User satisfaction came in last at 63% (SD 1.70). The overall usability score for all systems was calculated to be 66%. Conclusions: The usability of EMR systems implemented in sub-Saharan Africa has been good with ease of learning possibly being the biggest positive contributor to this rating. Cognitive load and effectiveness have also possibly positively influenced the usability of EMR systems, whereas efficiency and user satisfaction have perhaps contributed least to positively influencing EMR system usability.",Decision support system; Health care; Usability; Metric (unit); Medical physics; Management system; Implementation; Quality (business); Computer science; Cognitive load,computer systems; delivery of health care; review; sub-Saharan Africa,,10.2196/humanfactors.9317,true

Zayapragassarazan; Santosh Kumar,"Introduction Telemedicine is an emerging technology in health sector in India. The success of any new technology depends on many factors including the knowledge and understanding of the concept, skills acquired, attitude towards technology and working environment by the concerned professionals. Aim The main objective of this study was to assess the awareness, knowledge, attitude and skills of telemedicine among the health professionals working in the teaching hospitals of Puducherry Region of India. Materials and methods A cross-sectional survey was carried out among various healthcare professionals using a proper sampling frame obtained from a list of teaching hospitals located in Puducherry Union Territory, India. A total of 120 teaching faculties and practitioners from the preclinical, para-clinical and clinical departments were taken up for the study. A pre-validated self-administered questionnaire was used for the survey to assess the awareness, knowledge, attitude and skills of telemedicine. The questionnaires were mailed to the respondents and the completed questionnaires were analysed as per the study objectives using descriptive statistics for the quantitative data and content analysis for the qualitative data. Results The knowledge level of the respondents was found to be good with 41% of the respondents, 35% possess fair knowledge and 24% don't have adequate knowledge of telemedicine. With regard to the attitude towards telemedicine 39% of the respondents possess high attitude, 31% possess moderate attitude and 30% possess low level of attitude. Investigations on the skills of the respondents on telemedicine showed that 19% respondents are highly skilled or experts, 25% are moderately skilled which includes learners or beginners, and 56% are unskilled in handling telemedicine and its related equipments. Conclusion The findings of the study suggest that although the respondents experience and knowledge are limited in telemedicine technology a fair number of them have positive attitude towards telemedicine. It is the need of the hour to educate and train the teaching faculty, practicing physicians, residents, medical students and other health professionals about telemedicine and issues related to its use.",Information technology; Nursing; Content analysis; Sampling frame; Knowledge level; Telemedicine; Descriptive statistics; Internship; Medicine; Qualitative property,Internship; MCI Regulations; Training and Curriculum; Utilization,,10.7860/jcdr/2016/19080.7431,true

Methods A retrospective, cross-sectional, matched cohort study was conducted using Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2005-2015) data. The base study sample consisted of adults (age ≥18 years) who were alive and had positive total healthcare expenditures during the survey calendar year. Adults with MS were propensity-matched (1:1) to non-MS controls based on age, gender, and race/ethnicity using greedy matching algorithm. Healthcare expenditures consisted of total and subtypes of expenditures. Health status consisted of perceived physical and mental health status. Comorbidities were identified using ICD-9-CM and Clinical Classification System codes. Ordinary least squares regression and multinomial logistic regression were used to analyze the healthcare expenditures and health status variables, respectively. Results Final study sample consisted of 541 adults in each MS and non-MS control groups after propensity score matching. After adjusting for potential confounders, individuals with MS had greater total and subtypes of expenditures compared to non-MS controls, and several comorbidities (eg, depression, hypertension) were significantly associated with increased healthcare expenditures. Yearly average total expenditures (expressed in 2018 US$) were significantly (p<0.001) higher for adults with MS ($29,396) than propensity score-matched non-MS adults ($7875). Moreover, after adjusting for all individual-level factors, adults with MS experienced 363% (p<0.001) higher total expenditures compared to propensity score-matched non-MS controls. Individuals with MS were more likely to report poorer physical and good mental health status compared to propensity score-matched non-MS controls, and several comorbidities (eg, anxiety, depression) were significant independent predictors of poorer health status. For example, adults with MS were four times more likely (OR: 4.10, 95% CI: 2.42-6.96) to report fair/poor physical health status compared to excellent/very good physical health status compared with non-MS controls. Adults with MS were 42% (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.01-1.99) more likely than propensity score-matched non-MS controls to report good rather than very good or excellent mental health status. However, there was no difference between adults with MS and propensity score-matched non-MS controls in terms of reporting fair or poor than very good or excellent mental health status.

This review aims to highlight how clinical microbiology laboratories can contribute to patient safety. They can bring down medical errors through clinical collaboration and quality control. Timely and accurate inputs from microbiology laboratory help in clinical correlation and aid in safe patient care. Through internet search, using keywords such as “medical errors” and “quality assurance,” global burden of medical errors has been compiled. References have been taken from guidelines and documents of standard national and international agencies, systematic reviews, observational studies, retrospective analyses, meta-analyses, health bulletins and reports, and personal views. Safety in healthcare should lay emphasis on prevention, reporting, analysis, and correction of medical errors. If not recorded, medical errors are regarded as occasional or chance events. Global data show adverse events are as high as 10% among hospitalized patients, and approximately two-thirds of these are reported from low- to middle-income countries (LMICs). This includes errors in laboratories as well. Clinical microbiology can impact patient safety when practiced properly with an aim to detect, control, and prevent infections at the earliest. It is a science that integrates a tripartite relationship between the patient, clinician, and a microbiology specialist. Through collaborative healthcare, all stakeholders benefit by understanding common errors and mitigate them through quality management. However, errors tend to happen despite standardization and streamlining all processes. The aim should be to minimize them, have fair documentation, and learn from mistakes to avoid repetition. Local targets should be set and then extended to meet national and global benchmarks.</jats:p>",Patient safety; Standardization; Health care; Documentation; Clinical microbiology; Observational study; Quality (philosophy); Medicine; Medical emergency; Computer science; Pathology; Political science; Philosophy; Microbiology; Epistemology; Law; Biology; Programming language; Operating system,,,10.1055/s-0042-1744390,true

The causes and costs of the hostile environment in the NHS,2019,journal article,Health care analysis : HCA : journal of health philosophy and policy,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Netherlands,Arianne Shahvisi,"During the ""age of austerity"" the UK government has progressively limited free health services for ""overseas visitors"" on the grounds of fairness and frugality. This is despite the fact that the cost of the additional bureaucracy required by the new system and the public health consequences are expected to exceed the sums saved. In this article I explore the interaction between the discourses of austerity and xenophobia as they relate to migrants' access to healthcare. By examining the available data and adjudicating various moral arguments, I cast doubt on the claim that the current charging regulations are cost-effective and fair. I instead contend that if the UK is concerned with running a health service that is economically-sustainable and morally-defensible, it is critical that migrants are welcomed, both as staff and as patients. I conclude by arguing that xenophobia has precipitated changes to the health service which do not qualify as ""austerity"" in the way that is claimed, but rather deliberately produce a ""hostile environment"" for migrants, despite this very likely generating economic losses.",Public health; Political economy; Racism; Government; Health care; Political science; Frugality; Xenophobia; Bureaucracy; Austerity,Austerity; Cosmopolitanism; Migrants; NHS; Racism; Xenophobia,Health Services/economics; Health Services Accessibility/economics; Humans; Public Health; Racism; State Medicine; Transients and Migrants; United Kingdom; Xenophobia,10.1007/s10728-019-00374-w,true

Day; Blanca Gallego,"The identification of patients at high risk of unplanned readmission is an important component of discharge planning strategies aimed at preventing unwanted returns to hospital. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors associated with unplanned readmission in a Sydney hospital. We developed and compared validated readmission risk scores using routinely collected hospital data to predict 7-day, 30-day and 60-day all-cause unplanned readmission. A combination of gradient boosted tree algorithms for variable selection and logistic regression models was used to build and validate readmission risk scores using medical records from 62,235 live discharges from a metropolitan hospital in Sydney, Australia. The scores had good calibration and fair discriminative performance with c-statistic of 0.71 for 7-day and for 30-day readmission, and 0.74 for 60-day. Previous history of healthcare utilization, urgency of the index admission, old age, comorbidities related to cancer, psychosis, and drug-abuse, abnormal pathology results at discharge, and being unmarried and a public patient were found to be important predictors in all models. Unplanned readmissions beyond 7 days were more strongly associated with longer hospital stays and older patients with higher number of comorbidities and higher use of acute care in the past year. This study demonstrates similar predictors and performance to previous risk scores of 30-day unplanned readmission. Shorter-term readmissions may have different causal pathways than 30-day readmission, and may, therefore, require different screening tools and interventions. This study also re-iterates the need to include more informative data elements to ensure the appropriateness of these risk scores in clinical practice.",Health informatics; Logistic regression; Emergency medicine; Medical record; Psychological intervention; Acute care; Causal pathways; Unplanned readmission; All cause mortality; Medicine,Hospital readmission; Readmission risk scores,"Hospitals, Teaching/statistics & numerical data; Hospitals, Urban/statistics & numerical data; Humans; New South Wales; Patient Discharge/statistics & numerical data; Patient Readmission/statistics & numerical data; Prognosis; Risk Assessment/statistics & numerical data; Time Factors",10.1186/s12911-017-0580-8,true

Claassens,"Tuberculosis control programs rely on accurate collection of routine surveillance data to inform program decisions including resource allocation and specific interventions. The electronic TB register (ETR.Net) is dependent on accurate data transcription from both paperbased clinical records and registers at the facilities to report treatment outcome data. The study describes the quality of reporting of TB treatment outcomes from facilities in the Ehlanzeni District, Mpumalanga Province. A descriptive crossectional study of primary healthcare facilities in the district for the period 1 January – 31 December 2010 was performed. New smear positive TB cure rate data was obtained from the ETR.Net followed by verification of paperbased clinical records, both TB folders and the TB register, of 20% of all new smear positive cases across the district for correct reporting to the ETR.Net. Facilities were grouped according to high (>70%) and low cure rates (≤ 70%) as well as high (> 20%) and low (≤ 20%) error proportions in reporting. Kappa statistic was used to determine agreement between paperbased record, TB register and ETR.Net. Of the100 facilities (951 patient clinical records), 51(51%) had high cure rates and high error proportions, 14(14%) had a high cure rate and low error proportion whereas 30(30%) had low cure rates and high error proportions and five (5%) had a low cure rate with low error proportion. Fair agreement was observed (Kappa = 0.33) overall and between registers. Of the 473 patient clinical records which indicated cured, 383(81%) was correctly captured onto the ETR.Net, whereas 51(10.8%) was incorrectly captured and 39(8.2%) was not captured at all. Over reporting of treatment success of 12% occurred on the ETR.Net.

C. Goon; David Greenberg; Laszlo Igali; Nick J. Levell,"Background: Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) is an infrequent but highly aggressive skin cancer. Five-year survival rates are poor, as there are high rates of metastases at primary diagnoses. Recurrences are also common. There is controversy about actual incidence rates which vary considerably between developed countries with majority populations of fair skin types.  Objectives: We report the age-standardized incidence rates of MCC for both males and females from the East of England, and use linear regression analyses to estimate numbers of cases for 2020 and 2025 to aid healthcare planning and allocation of resources.  Methods: All cases of MCC diagnosed histopathologically between 1(st) January 2004 and 31(st) December 2013 were extracted from the databases of the Eastern Office, National Cancer Registration Service, Public Health England, and the Pathology department of the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, which serves as the tertiary referral centre for the region. Age-standardization incidence rate calculations (ASIs) and linear regression analyses were performed.  Results: The ASIs for males and females were 0.70 and 1.08 per 100 000 person-years respectively. The total age-adjusted incidence rate was therefore 1.78 per 100 000 person-years. The ratio of female: male disease was 3:2. The total number of cases for this region over the time period studied was 73. There has been a threefold increase over this period. Estimated cases for this region are 17 in 2020, and 22 in 2025. Estimated UK cases for 2020 are 920, and 1134 in 2025.  Conclusions: MCC is increasing steadily in the East of England, and has risen threefold over the last 10 years and is similar to the highest reported rates from Western Australia. These data are 12-fold higher than previous UK estimates, and suggest that the incidence rate is also rising in other regions of the UK.",Public health; Surgery; Demography; Developed country; Young adult; Carcinoma; Skin cancer; Merkel cell carcinoma; University hospital; Incidence (epidemiology); Medicine,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/epidemiology; Child; Child, Preschool; England; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology; Young Adult",10.1111/jdv.13828,false

This study aimed to analyze the disequilibrium in primary health care (PHC) workforce among various economic zones in China and to compare the fairness between urban and rural areas since the implementation of the new medical reforms. According to China’s 11th Five-Year Plan, China is divided into eight economic regions. The data of this study were obtained from China Statistical Yearbook 2009–2016. The Atkinson index was used to depict the trend of PHC workforce fairness; the Gini coefficient was used to compare the fairness of workforce distribution between urban and rural areas; the health resource agglomeration degree was used to analyze the distributional equity of the workforce in the eight regions; and the Theil Index was used to compare the fairness of urban and rural workforce distribution across eight regions. The Atkinson index indicated that the equity of the entire PHC workforce allocation had generally improved during the new medical reforms; the Gini coefficient indicated that the fairness of the entire workforce allocation had improved in cities, but only the nurse allocation became fairer in rural areas. The agglomeration degree and the Theil index indicated that the fairness gaps across the eight regions were still large. These analyses differed from previous studies where China was divided into western, central and eastern regions. In what was previously defined as eastern region, the northeast was under-resourced, while the eastern coastal areas were observing a resource surplus. In western region, we found that the fairness in the northwest was significantly worse than southwest. In China, the distribution of healthcare workforce has been improved with continuous effort. The gaps in the distribution of PHC workforce across different economic regions and between urban and rural areas are still large, with different regions facing different problems.

(2) Objectives: To assess the impact of social inequalities in the health outcomes of COVID-19 during the first epidemic wave in Piedmont Region, Italy, evaluating the role of the unequal social distribution of comorbidities and the capacity of the healthcare system to promote equity. (3) Methods: Subjects aged over 35, resident in Piedmont on 22 February 2020, were followed up until 30 May 2020 for access to swabs, infection, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit, in-hospital death, COVID-19, and all-cause death. Inequalities were assessed through an Index of Socioeconomic Disadvantage composed of information on education, overcrowding, housing conditions, and neighborhood deprivation. Relative incidence measures and Relative Index of Inequality were estimated through Poisson regression models, stratifying by gender and age groups (35-64 years; ≥65 years), adjusting for comorbidity. (4) Results: Social inequalities were found in the various outcomes, in the female population, and among elderly males. Inequalities in ICU were lower, but analyses only on in-patients discount the hypothesis of preferential access by the most advantaged. Comorbidities contribute to no more than 30% of inequalities. (5) Conclusions: Despite the presence of significant inequities, the pandemic does not appear to have further exacerbated health inequalities, partly due to the fairness of the healthcare system.

The present study aimed to investigate the relationships between SRH among female healthcare students and their lifestyle factors, such as living status (living with others or living alone), smoking habit, alcohol consumption, frequency of breakfast consumption (FBC), physical activity, insomnia, and physique recognition. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 1101 female healthcare students in Japan. The body mass index was calculated from the body height and weight using data from periodic health examinations. Self-reported sociodemographic, lifestyle or dietary habits, physical activity, and SRH were used through a self-administered questionnaire. Participants were classified as having either good SRH (excellent, very good, or good) or impaired SRH (fair or poor). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the independent relationships between SRH and lifestyle factors. A total of 11.4% participants demonstrated impaired SRH.

Sullivan,"Introduction Given the high prevalence of smoking among Veterans and the economic, social, and clinical implications, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to smoking in order to focus efforts to mitigate these factors and improve smoking cessation efforts among Veterans. The availability of research on smoking in Veterans compared with civilians is limited given the military-specific differences in their life course. We aimed to identify military-specific factors combined with sociodemographic factors for ever smoking and current smoking among Veterans to inform future interventions. Materials and methods We used data from the 2010 National Survey of Veterans, the most current, to analyze the association of sociodemographic and military-specific factors with ever versus never smoking, and current versus past smoking using multiple variable logistic regression models (IRB#4125). Results Among 8,618 respondents, the proportions of current, past, and never smokers were 17%, 48%, and 34%, respectively. Sociodemographic factors associated with ever smoking were female gender, educational attainment of less than a bachelor's degree, and being divorced/separated/widowed. Military-specific factors associated with ever smoking were exposure to dead/dying/wounded soldiers during service, and past, current, and unsure enrollment in Veterans Affairs healthcare. Never smoking was associated with Hispanic ethnicity, income over $75,000, and reporting fair or poor health. Military factors associated with never smoking were presence of a service-connected disability and military service July 1964 or earlier (i.e., pre-Vietnam). Among 5,652 ever smokers, sociodemographic factors associated with current smoking were age less than 65, being non-Hispanic black, educational attainment of less than a bachelor's degree, being divorced/separated/widowed, never married, and having no insurance. Factors associated with reduced likelihood of current smoking compared with past smoking included income >$41,000 and reporting fair or poor health. Military-specific variables associated with reduced likelihood of current smoking were service era of May 1975 or later (i.e., post-Vietnam) and 5 or more years of service. Conclusion Military-specific variables are associated with smoking behaviors among Veterans. Findings from this study that exposure to dead/dying/wounded soldiers, service era, duration of service, service-connected disability status, and enrollment in VA care all influence smoking in Veterans, can inform prevention and cessation efforts in part by encouraging alternative healthy habits or cessation techniques in subgroups of Veterans with particular military backgrounds. By assessing risk factors in this unique population future research can leverage these findings to determine mechanisms that help explain these associations. Identifying factors associated with smoking offers insights for smoking cessation and prevention interventions given the military experiences and increased smoking incidence among Veterans.",Demography; Life course approach; Psychological intervention; Veterans Affairs; Military service; Smoking cessation; Military personnel; Educational attainment; Population; Medicine,,Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Incidence; Income/statistics & numerical data; Male; Marital Status/statistics & numerical data; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Racial Groups/statistics & numerical data; Smoking/epidemiology; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States/epidemiology; Veterans/psychology,10.1093/milmed/usy115,true

Assessing the horizontal and vertical equity in healthcare utilisation among older Ghanaians.,2018,journal article,International journal for equity in health,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,United Kingdom,Vincent Dei; Miguel San Sebastian,"There is a lack of focused research on the older population in Ghana and about issues pertaining to their access to healthcare services. Furthermore, information is lacking regarding the fairness in the access to these services. This study aimed to ascertain whether horizontal and vertical equity requirements were being met in the healthcare utilisation among older adults aged 50 years and above. This study was based on a secondary cross-sectional data from the World Health Organization’s Study on global AGEing (SAGE) and adult health wave 1 conducted from 2007 to 2008 in Ghana. Data on 4304 older adults aged 50 years-plus were analysed. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were carried out to analyse the association between outpatient/inpatient utilisation and (1) socioeconomic status (SES), controlling for need variables (horizontal equity) and (2) need variables, controlling for SES (vertical equity). Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to analyse the association between relevant variables. Horizontal and vertical inequities were found in the utilisation of outpatient services. Inpatient healthcare utilisation was both horizontally and vertically equitable. Women were found to be more likely to use outpatient services than men but had reduced odds of using inpatient services. Possessing a health insurance was also significantly associated with the use of both inpatient and outpatient services. Whilst equity exists in inpatient care utilisation, more needs to be done to achieve equity in the access to outpatient services. The study reaffirms the need to evaluate both the horizontal and vertical dimensions in the assessment of equity in healthcare access. It provides the basis for further research in bridging the healthcare access inequity gap among older adults in Ghana.",Public health; Socioeconomic status; Health care; Inpatient care; Health services research; Health policy; Equity (economics); Horizontal and vertical; Medicine; Environmental health,Ghana; Healthcare utilisation; Horizontal equity; Older adults; Socioeconomic status; Vertical equity,Age Factors; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Ghana; Health Services/statistics & numerical data; Health Services Accessibility/economics; Healthcare Disparities/economics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Sex Factors; Social Class,10.1186/s12939-018-0791-3,true

More specifically, the aim is to add insights to accounting practices and their applicability towards a newly establish value-based agenda with a focus on patient-level cost data. Methods We apply a cost accounting framework developed to position and understand hospital cost practices in relation to government requirements. Allocated cost account data from 2015 from all Danish hospitals were collected and analyzed. These cost accounts lay the foundation for diagnosis related group (DRG) rate setting. We further compare the data's limitations and potential in a value-based healthcare (VBHC) agenda with the aim of implementing time-driven activity based costing (TDABC). Results We find exceedingly aggregated department-level data that are not tied to patient information. We investigate these data and find large data skewness in the current system, mainly due to structural variances within hospitals. We further demonstrate the current costs data's lack of suitability for VBHC but with suggestions of how cost data can become applicable for such an approach, which will increase cost data transparency and, thus, provide a better foundation for both local and national decision-making. Conclusions The findings raise concerns about the cost accounts' ability to provide valid information in healthcare decision-making due to a lack of transparency and obvious variances that distort budgets and production-value estimates. The standardization of costs stemming from hospitals with large organizational differences has significant implications on the fairness of resource allocation and decision-making at large. Thus, for hospitals to become more cost efficient, a substantially more detailed clinically bottom-led cost account system is essential to provide better information for prioritization in health.",Risk analysis (engineering); Cost efficiency; Health administration; Health informatics; Cost database; Activity-based costing; Diagnosis-related group; Transparency (graphic); Medicine; Cost accounting,Cost accounting; DRG; Hospitals; Value-based healthcare,Denmark; Diagnosis-Related Groups; Feasibility Studies; Hospital Costs; Humans; Time Factors,10.1186/s12913-021-06807-4,true

In theory, the combination of healthcare Big Data with modern, data-hungry artificial intelligence techniques should offer significant opportunities for artificial intelligence development, but this has not yet happened. Here we discuss some of the structural reasons for this, barriers preventing artificial intelligence from making full use of existing datasets, and make suggestions as to enable progress.

They are perceived as the opinion leaders within their communities; therefore, their health-related beliefs and attitudes are deemed important for public health campaigns. This study aimed to investigate the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy drivers among university students in the Czech Republic. Methods: a cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire was carried out in the weeks before the unrestricted vaccine deployment to Czech adults. The questionnaire had 21 multiple-choice items stratified in 4 categories; demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related anamnesis and influenza vaccine experience, attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination, and the possible drivers of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy suggested by the WHO-SAGE. Results: out of the 1351 included students, 66.8% were females, 84.5% were Czech nationals, and 40.6% enrolled in healthcare programs. The overall COVID-19 vaccine acceptance level was 73.3%, 19.3% of participants were vaccine-resistant, and only 7.4% were vaccine-hesitant. Trust in the pharmaceutical industry, trust in healthcare providers, and perceived knowledge sufficiency predicted higher odds of vaccine acceptance. In contrast, media and social media, personal beliefs, immunity misconception, previous COVID-19 infection, and suspicions about novel vaccines and the local availability predicted higher odds of vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: The findings of this study predict a fair probability to achieve community immunity (herd immunity) among the target population group.

Mixed methods were used, comprising qualitative (document analysis and focus group interviews) and quantitative (a small-scale questionnaire survey) data. Document analysis summarized professionalism dilemma items from previous publications. For focus group interviews, we used narrative inquiry to explore and make sense of residents' experiences and perceptions of professionalism dilemmas. A small-scale questionnaire survey was conducted during each focus group to investigate the proportion of professionalism dilemma items that residents reported to have heard of, witnessed, or experienced. Through document analysis and focus group interviews, we developed a checklist of professionalism dilemmas based on a behavior-based professionalism framework.

This study aimed to explore motivations and concerns associated with COVID-19 vaccination among adults seeking their first COVID-19 vaccine in a regional Australian community with low prevalence of COVID-19, who received a medical consult prior to vaccination. Medical records from consults were audited and the modified Framework Method was used to conduct qualitative content analysis of data, generating themes and overall core concepts related to motivations for COVID-19 vaccination and associated concerns. There were 102 people included in the study, 81% of whom were aged ≥60 years. Concerns surrounding COVID-19 vaccination included five core concepts: 1. Perceived vaccine risks, 2. Perceived vaccine performance, 3. Uncertainty, 4. Autonomy, and 5. Fairness in access; and a further five core concepts were generated from motivations to seek vaccination: 1. Protection, 2. Occupational or facility responsibility or requirement, 3. Trust in primary healthcare physician, 4. Autonomy, and 5. Civic duty.

M. Elsman; Leo D. Roorda; Martine H. P. Crins; Maarten Boers; Caroline B. Terwee,"To add context to the impact of medical conditions, it is important to interpret and compare health outcomes across studies and populations. We aimed to determine Dutch reference values for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Scale v1.2 - Global Health (PROMIS-GH). The PROMIS-GH, also referred to as PROMIS-10, was completed by 4370 Dutch persons, representative for the 2016 Dutch population. T-scores for the mental health (GMH) and physical health (GPH) subscales, and their shorter two-item subscales, were calculated for the entire population, age groups and gender. T-scores for GMH and GPH were compared to the US reference population, representative for the 2000 US general population. Interpretability thresholds for poor, fair, good, very good and excellent GPH and GMH were calculated based on T-scores of participants, which were categorized into five groups based on their response to item Global01. For each group the mean GPH and GMH T-score was calculated and the midpoint between two adjacent means was identified, resulting in thresholds. Thresholds based on the Dutch data were compared to US thresholds. The Dutch population had a GMH T-score of 44.7 and a GPH T-score of 45.2, both substantially worse than the US reference population T-score of 50. Lower T-scores were also found for age-range and gender subpopulations. Dutch GMH and GPH interpretability thresholds were mostly not substantially different compared to the US thresholds, although the Dutch threshold between fair and poor mental health was considerably higher (29 vs. 38). This study reports reference values for the PROMIS-GH scale for the Dutch general population, including age-range and gender subpopulations. These reference values provide an important tool for healthcare professionals and researchers to better evaluate and interpret patient-reported mental health and physical health. Scores are notably worse than the US reference values. The exact reason for this remains subject for further research, although possibilities for the differences are discussed, including the presence of differential item functioning and the representativeness and recentness of the data.",Mental health; Demography; Psychology; Differential item functioning; Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System; Context (language use); Population; Representativeness heuristic; Global health; Scale (social sciences),General population reference values; Global Health; PROMIS; Patient-reported outcome measures,,10.1186/s41687-021-00314-0,true

This study explores the challenges of reference standard selection and aims to ascertain which combination of clinical assessment items best identify sciatica in people seeking primary healthcare.; ; Methods; ; ; Data on 394 low back-related leg pain consulters were analysed. Potential sciatica indicators were seven clinical assessment items. Two reference standards were used: (i) high confidence sciatica clinical diagnosis; (ii) high confidence sciatica clinical diagnosis with confirmatory magnetic resonance imaging findings. Multivariable logistic regression models were produced for both reference standards. A tool predicting sciatica diagnosis in low back-related leg pain was derived. Latent class modelling explored the validity of the reference standard.; ; Results; ; Model (i) retained five items; model (ii) retained six items. Four items remained in both models: below knee pain, leg pain worse than back pain, positive neural tension tests and neurological deficit.

European Publishing,Greece,Fotini Gialama; Maria Saridi; Panagiotis Prezerakos; Yiannis Pollalis; Xenofon Contiades; Kyriakos Souliotis,"Introduction One of the greatest challenges in the healthcare field is planning the health workforce under limited financial resources while being fully capable of responding to an affordable, fair and efficient healthcare system. This study aimed to demonstrate the implementation process of the health workforce planning tool 'Workload Indicators of Staffing Needs' introduced by the World Health Organization. Methods A descriptive and cross-sectional study was carried out at four (two public and two private) hospitals in Greece, to estimate midwifery staff requirements at ward level during 2015-2016, using the WISN software tool. Focus group discussions, structured interviews and annual service statistics from the hospitals' records were used to obtain data. Results Results for both private hospitals showed a shortage in the number of midwives. However, after combining the interpretation of the results, as indicated by the WISN methodology and the structured interviews, current and required staffing is in balance in both. On the other hand, both public hospitals indicate a surplus of midwives (1.83 and 1.33 ratios for the General hospitals in Korinthos and Kalamata, respectively). Conclusions This study demonstrated the implementation process of the WISN methodology through its application in midwifery staff at four hospitals in Greece and confirmed its usefulness in estimating staffing requirements. The application of the WISN methodology should be viewed as a vital tool in assessing overstaffing and understaffing through the estimation of workload pressure among different categories of health staff, thus providing the basis for effective health workforce redistribution in Greece.",Structured interview; Obstetrics; Business; Workforce planning; Health care; Staffing; Workforce; Workload; Service (systems architecture); Focus group,health workforce planning; hospital; midwifery; staffing; workload indicators,,10.18332/ejm/100559,true

017-864-269-074-869,“Following orders” as a critique on healthcare allocation committees: An anthropological perspective on the role of public memory in bioethical legitimacy,2021,journal article,Bioethics,Wiley,United Kingdom,Yael Assor,"The public perception of decision-making procedures as fair processes is a central means for establishing their legitimacy to make difficult resource allocation decisions. According to the ethical framework of accountability for reasonableness (A4R, hereafter), which specifies conditions for fair healthcare resource allocation, disagreements about what constitutes relevant considerations are a central threat to its perceived fairness. This article considers how an ethical principle grounded in the public memory of past traumatic events may become the topic of such disagreements. I demonstrate this through an anthropological case study of a recent public de bate concerning an Israeli healthcare allocation committee (HAC, thereafter), which determines state subsidies for new medical technologies as part of Israel's public healthcare system. Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork about the HAC, I show how the public memory of Adolf Eichmann's trial constitutes a bioethical problem for the committee's legitimacy. Based on Arendt's and Bauman's writings that Nazi bureaucrats' manner of ""following orders"" was an ethical transgression, some patients contended that the committee has a historical responsibility to question its strict adherence to bureaucratic procedures. Since the committee did not have a direct link to the events of the Holocaust, other considerations seemed to them more relevant. I then present an offer that can settle this disagreement and maintain the HAC's legitimacy according to A4R. I conclude by discussing the contribution of empirical data to models of bioethical legitimacy.",Health care; Political science; Bioethics; Law and economics; Accountability; State (polity); Resource allocation; Legitimacy; Bureaucracy; Subsidy,Israel; accountability for reasonableness; healthcare allocation; legitimacy; post-Holocaust ethics; public memory,Health Priorities; Humans; Resource Allocation; Social Responsibility,10.1111/bioe.12890,false

The present study was conducted in Tehran, the political and economic capital of Iran, to determine the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and identify its associated factors, and explain the most important barriers and acceptance strategies for vaccination. This research was a concurrent quantitative and qualitative mixed-method study. In the quantitative part, 1200 individuals aged more than 18 years were selected from the households in 22 districts of Tehran City, with a multistage stratified cluster sampling method. Two questionnaires were used to evaluate the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine acceptance determinants. The qualitative content analysis method addressed the influencing factors, as well as challenges and strategies related to the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in four groups of Tehran inhabitants: the elderly, people with underlying diseases, healthcare workers, and the general population. The related data were simultaneously collected by applying in-depth semi-structural interviews and a data analysis process. Furthermore, we used the Graneheim and Lundman method for data analysis. We analyzed the data of 1200 people with a mean (SD) age of 46.4 (11.1) years, and approximately 58% of them were men. The vaccine acceptance was 83.6% (95% CI: 81.3-85.9). Among those who welcomed vaccination, 58% preferred the imported vaccines, 25% the Iranian ones, and 17% both. There was a significant association between the variables of age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.01-2.93), being single (AOR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.41-0.91), moderate pharmacotherapy adherence (AOR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.4-0.85), and the willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Qualitative study after interviewing 45 people from four study groups showed an insufficient social trust in healthcare system officials, pharmaceutical and vaccine production companies; distrust in the effectiveness of the vaccines, concerns about the vaccine adverse effects, being tracked by microchips after vaccination, traditional anti-vaccination movements, the feeling the inessentiality of vaccination, and uncertainty about the fair distribution of the vaccine. These concerns were the main challenges addressed by the study groups. A good proportion of Tehran residents reported their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, they expressed their critical concerns, such as insufficient trust in the healthcare system, vaccine safeties, and adverse effects that were the significant barriers to vaccine acceptance. It seems that conflicts raised by the shortage of vaccines and their import due to the sanctions have led to intense desire and demand in the general population, and especially the elderly, for vaccination.

TSC patients with documented visits to our local public hospitals in 1995–2018 were identified. The public hospitals captured most if not all local TSC patients. Demographics such as age, sex, death, genetic profiles were retrieved from the central electronic database. Data including prevalence, age distribution and survival rate were analysed. Direct cost was calculated with reference to the drug use and number of visits to various public hospital facilities. We identified 284 surviving TSC patients (55.3% male) in Hong Kong. The age range was from 4.5 months to 89.9 years, with a median age of 27.2 years. Paediatrics (< 18 years) to adult (≥18 years) ratio was 1:2.84. The overall prevalence of TSC patients was 3.87 in 100,000 (i.e. 1 in 25,833). Genetically, TSC1:TSC2 ratio is 1:2.7. Thirty seven patients died within the study period. The age of death ranged from 7.6 years to 77.8 years, with a median age of death at 36.6 years (IQR: 24.7–51.1 years). Most patients survived till adulthood. Survival rate at 20 and 50 years follow-up was 98.6 and 79.5% respectively. Two hundred and twenty nine TSC patients (71.3%) had neurological manifestations, sixteen patients (5.0%) had chronic kidney diseases and five patients (1.6%) had pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Forty seven (16.5%) TSC patients were prescribed with mTOR inhibitors within the study period. Healthcare facility utilization was further analysed in the 2008–2018 cohort. In particular, the mean number of specialist out-patient clinic visits per patient-year was 9.23 per patient-year, which was 4.91 times more than that of local general population. Prevalence of local TSC patients is within the range of that reported in the literature. Local TSC patients have fair long term survival, but they require disproportionally high healthcare cost when compared with the general population, particularly in terms of outpatient (OP) visits. Although effective disease-modifying agent (i.e. mTOR inhibitor) is available, it was not widely used yet in Hong Kong despite the fact that Government approved and supported its use recently.

Ornstein; Yan Li; Bian Liu,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the importance of using information and communication technology (ICT) to address daily and healthcare needs. The barriers for older adults in the United States to learn a new technology to go online during the pandemic remain to be studied. METHODS: Using data from the 2019-2020 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a nationally representative survey of older Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older in the United States, we used multivariable logistic regression models to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with learning a new technology to go online during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Our sample represented 23,547,688 older adults nationally, of which the majority (60.2%) increased ICT use during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most older adults (71.8%) did not report learning a new technology to go online. Those who did not learn a new technology to go online had less of an increase in ICT use than those who learned either with help or by themselves (50.7% vs. 78.4% or 89.2% respectively, p < 0.01). The odds of learning a new technology decreased with increasing age (aOR [95%CI] = 0.96 [0.94-0.98]), being male (aOR [95%CI] = 0.56 [0.45-0.72]), having lower than high school educational attainment (aOR [95%CI] = 0.38 [0.29-0.50]), decreasing income levels (aORs ranged from 0.28 to 0.54), and self-reported fair or poor general health (aOR [95%CI] = 0.65 [0.47-0.90]).

It is against this backdrop that Ghana instituted nursing licensing examination which includes clinical competency assessment. This qualitative exploratory descriptive study sought to explore and describe the perspectives of key informants on the clinical nursing competency assessment in Ghana. A total of 20 purposively selected key informants (nurse educators, nurse clinicians, and nurse managers) were interviewed. Data was analyzed using thematic content analysis. Although the intention of the clinical competency examination conducted by the nursing council is to ensure that only competent nurses are licensed to practice in Ghana, there are inherent issues such as manipulation of examiners, poor training of examiners, unstandardized assessment process, and inadequate resource which compromises the intent of the process. The nursing council admitted to not being aware of some of the challenges found in this study and will work towards improving the quality, validity, reliability, and fairness of the examination system. It is essential that the council institute quality improvement processes, including independent research into the examination process, to continually improve on the process because other countries within the sub-region try to benchmark their nursing licensing examination on that of Ghana.</jats:p>",Nursing; Thematic analysis; Nursing process; Quality (philosophy); Medicine; Health care; Exploratory research; Qualitative research; Medical education; Psychology; Political science; Social science; Philosophy; Epistemology; Sociology; Anthropology; Law,,,10.1177/21582440221089960,true

Understanding this association can potentiate improvement in healthcare delivery. We evaluated the association between patients' ratings of the quality of healthcare services received and uptake of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Subject and methods We used two iterations of the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) of adults in the United States. HINTS 2007 (4,007 respondents; weighted population=75,397,128) evaluated whether respondents were up-to-date with CRC screening while HINTS 4 cycle 3 (1,562 respondents; weighted population=76,628,000) evaluated whether participants had ever received CRC screening in the past. All included respondents from both surveys were at least 50 years of age, had no history of CRC, and had rated the quality of healthcare services that they had received at their healthcare provider's office in the previous 12 months. Results HINTS 2007 data showed that respondents who rated their healthcare as good, or fair/poor were significantly less likely to be up to date with CRC screening compared to those who rated their healthcare as excellent. We found comparable results from analysis of HINTS 4 cycle 3 data with poorer uptake of CRC screening as the healthcare quality ratings of respondents' reduced. Conclusion Our study suggested that patients who reported receiving lower quality of healthcare services were less likely to have undergone and be compliant with CRC screening recommendations.

H. van Zanten,"Summary Background & aims Gaining insight into readily obtainable baseline characteristics that allow prediction of adverse outcome in COVID-19 aids both treatment and healthcare planning. Bioelectric impedance (BIA) Phase Angle (PhA) is correlated with outcome in a multitude of diseases and may be of added value in predicting adverse outcome of COVID-19. We aimed to associate baseline body composition parameters with 90-day adverse outcome of COVID-19 including ICU-admission and to explore the added predictive value of baseline PhA. Methods We performed a prospective observational study, conducting BIA amongst COVID-19 patients within 24 hours of hospital admission, with a follow-up of 90 days. Data were compared between ward-only and ICU-patients. Regression models were used to assess the associations between baseline characteristics, body composition and 90-day adverse outcome, including a composite outcome score of morbidity, ICU-admission, and mortality. An ROC-curve was used to explore the added predictive value of PhA to other clinical parameters at baseline for the prediction of adverse outcome. Results One-hundred-and-fifty patients were included. Mean age was 68 (66–70) years, 67% were male. Forty-one (27%) patients were admitted to ICU and 77 (51%) met the criteria of the composite outcome score. In multiple regression, PhA was independently, inversely correlated with risk of ICU-admission (OR .531, p = .021), complications (OR .579, p = .031), hospital length of stay (OR .875, p = .037) and the composite outcome score (OR .502, p = .012). An ROC-curve showed that the incorporation of PhA in a composite risk-score improved the discriminative power for the composite outcome from poor to fair, compared to individual predictors (AUC 0.79 (95% CI 0.71–0.87)). Conclusion BIA measurements including Phase Angle are independently correlated with an adverse outcome of COVID-19. Interpretation of Phase Angle can be a valuable addition to risk assessment of adverse outcome of COVID-19 at hospital admission.

The MapReduce programming model has been successfully used for big data analytics. However, data skew invariably occurs in big data analytics and seriously affects efficiency. To overcome the data skew problem in MapReduce, we have in the past proposed a data processing algorithm called Partition Tuning-based Skew Handling (PTSH). In comparison with the one-stage partitioning strategy used in the traditional MapReduce model, PTSH uses a two-stage strategy and the partition tuning method to disperse key-value pairs in virtual partitions and recombines each partition in case of data skew. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm were tested on a wide variety of simulated datasets and real healthcare datasets. The results showed that PTSH algorithm can handle data skew in MapReduce efficiently and improve the performance of MapReduce jobs in comparison with the native Hadoop, Closer, and locality-aware and fairness-aware key partitioning (LEEN). We also found that the time needed for rule extraction can be reduced significantly by adopting the PTSH algorithm, since it is more suitable for association rule mining (ARM) on healthcare data.",Data mining; Data processing; Association rule learning; Partition (database); Programming paradigm; Computer science; Skew; Big data; Cloud computing; Robustness (computer science),,Cloud Computing; Electronic Data Processing; Health Information Management; Humans; Information Systems,10.1155/2017/1425102,true

However, it is becoming increasingly challenging for humans to understand the working and reasoning of these complex and opaque algorithms. For AI to support essential decisions in these domains, specific ethical issues need to be addressed to prevent the misinterpretation of AI, which may have severe consequences for humans. However, little research has been published on guidelines that systematically addresses ethical issues when AI techniques are applied in healthcare. In this systematic literature review, we aimed to provide an overview of ethical concerns and related strategies that are currently identified when applying AI in healthcare. The review, which followed the PRISMA guidelines, revealed 12 main ethical issues: justice and fairness, freedom and autonomy, privacy, transparency, patient safety and cyber security, trust, beneficence, responsibility, solidarity, sustainability, dignity, and conflicts. In addition to these 12 main ethical issues, we derived 19 ethical sub-issues and associated strategies from the literature.</jats:p>",Beneficence; Autonomy; Engineering ethics; Health care; Dignity; Economic Justice; Transparency (behavior); Solidarity; Bioethics; Psychology; Management science; Political science; Engineering; Law; Politics,,,10.3390/ai4010003,true

Joint exposures were self-reported back pain and mental health conditions (fair/poor mental health, mood, and anxiety disorder). We built negative binomial, modified Poisson and linear (log-transformed) models to assess joint effects (effects of 2 exposures in combination) of comorbid back pain and mental health condition on healthcare utilization, opioid prescription, and costs. The models were adjusted for sociodemographic, health-related, and behavioural factors. We evaluated positive additive and multiplicative interaction (synergism) between back pain and mental health conditions with relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) and ratio of rate ratios (RRs). The cohort (n = 147,486) had a mean age of 46 years (SD = 17), and 51% were female. We found positive additive and multiplicative interaction between back pain and fair/poor mental health (RERI = 0.40; ratio of RR = 1.12) and mood disorder (RERI = 0.41; ratio of RR = 1.04) but not anxiety for back pain-specific utilization.

Around the world, we are seeing a significant growth in interest and investment in AI in healthcare. This has been coupled with rising concerns about the ethical implications of these technologies and an array of ethical guidelines for the use of AI and data in healthcare has arisen. Nevertheless, the question of if and how AI and data technologies can be ethical remains open to debate. This paper aims to contribute to this debate by considering the wide range of implications that have been attributed to these technologies and asking whether current ethical guidelines take these factors into account. In particular, the paper argues that while current ethics guidelines for AI in healthcare effectively account for the four key issues identified in the ethics literature (transparency; fairness; responsibility and privacy), they have largely neglected wider issues relating to the way in which these technologies shape institutional and social arrangements. This, I argue, has given current ethics guidelines a strong focus on evaluating the impact of these technologies on the individual, while not accounting for the powerful social shaping effects of these technologies.

022-878-725-524-05X,Adding a Correction Factor to the Allocation of Scarce Life-saving Resources in a Pandemic,2022,journal article,Voices in Bioethics,Columbia University Libraries,,Cathy Purvis Lively,"<jats:p>Photo by Richard Catabay on Unsplash; ABSTRACT; COVID-19 exposed deep-rooted structural inequities. Allocation protocols developed during COVID-19 may cause furtherance of structural inequalities. In this essay, I specifically address the issue of structural inequities in the context of resource allocation during a period of crisis standard of care. In response to the increasing evidence of structural inequities during the pandemic, physicians and bioethicists Douglas White and Bernard Lo proposed incorporating a correction factor into resource allocation protocols. According to them, this would provide an advantage for disadvantaged individuals. The proposed correction factors use the Area Deprivation Index to determine eligibility. I argue that the correction factor is ethically justified and supported by Rawls’s difference principle, Daniels’s equality of opportunity, and Harris’s double jeopardy argument. I also suggest that the proposed correction factor does not go far enough, particularly if used with other objective factors, such as SOFA scoring. At least one study shows that using SOFA scoring for resource allocation during COVID-19 has a discriminatory effect on non-Hispanic black patients. One problem with the correction factor using the ADI is that it only applies to those currently in the reflected socioeconomic status. Additionally, when only one hospital serves a largely socioeconomically disadvantaged community, all admissions will fall within the targeted category for application of the correction factor. Thus, further actions are needed to dismantle structural inequities, such as implementing load balancing or the planned sharing of resources among healthcare systems.; INTRODUCTION; COVID-19 forced deep-rooted structural inequities to the surface. SARS-CoV-2 was a novel virus, but the connection between structural inequities and the disparate impact of the virus on marginalized populations is not. The history of pandemics reflects how much structural inequities negatively influence health equity.[1] The lack of preparedness and response to the structural inequities exemplify “blistering systemic failures.”[2] Despite warnings from prior threats from SARS and H1N1, we were unprepared for COVID-19. Antommaria and Chelen show that one-half of responding hospitals did not have an allocation protocol in place.[3]; When an influx of critically ill patients and limited resources required implementing a crisis standard of care, many hospitals quickly established protocols addressing the allocation of scarce resources. Most crisis standard of care (CSC) protocols reflect public health’s utilitarian focus on saving the most lives.[4] The utilitarian focus ignores the disproportionate impact resulting from structural inequities.; In December 2020, two physicians and bioethicists, Douglas White and Bernard Lo responded to the increasing evidence of the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on disadvantaged communities by adding a correction factor to their CSC resource allocation protocol.  The correction factor adjusts triage scores of individuals living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods by subtracting one point from the triage score.[5] Patients with lower triage scores are more likely to receive life-saving care. Thus, subtracting a point provides an advantage.; The correction factor uses a composite measure of disadvantage to determine eligibility called the Area Deprivation Index (ADI).[6] The ADI is a geographic measure of socioeconomic disadvantage that calculates an aggregate disadvantage score on a 10-point scale. The ADI measures seventeen elements of disadvantage related to poverty, education, employment, physical environment, and infrastructure.[7] The correction factor compensates for structural injustices by using ADI scores of patients in the highest quartile of socioeconomic disadvantage or having an ADI score of 8 to 10 since the strongest association between ADI scores and health outcomes occurs at the highest ADI levels.[8]; l.     Ethical Justifications; Various theories of justice support applying the correction factor in the allocation of scarce resources. Rawls’s difference principle provides an ethical justification for the correction factor as it benefits the worse off in the event of resource allocation.[9] Applying the correction factor and subtracting one point from the triage score admittedly creates inequality among two otherwise like patients, but it is justified under Rawls’s theory since it gives the advantage to the least advantaged, addressing equity.; Norman Daniels’ argument for protecting fair “equality of opportunity” also supports the correction factor.[10] The correction factor protects the equality of opportunity for those denied access to care because of deep-rooted structural inequities exacerbated by the pandemic. Using the correction factor to provide access to life-saving resources compensates patients with diminished opportunities in other arenas like the social determinants of health.; Derek Parfit’s deontic egalitarianism supports the correction factor. Under Parfit’s view of deontic egalitarianism, justification of giving an advantage to the worse off depends on the reason for the inequality. If the unequal status results from circumstances such as a genetic condition or an accidental injury, like Daniel’s equality of opportunity, deontic egalitarianism does not support giving an advantage to the worse-off. If the unequal position results from the unjust actions of another, such as discriminatory treatment of people of color, deontic egalitarianism supports providing the advantage to address the inequity.[11] The disproportionate impact of resource allocation results from unjust treatment such as discrimination and structural inequity.[12]; John Harris’s double jeopardy argument adds additional support to the correction factor in that[13] the socioeconomically disadvantaged or those facing racial or ethnic discrimination may have had an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 or having a severe case or death due to structural inequities. If the triage procedures do not compensate for the structural inequities and they are precluded access to critical care based only on traditional triage, they will suffer double jeopardy. The correction factor avoids this double jeopardy.; ll.      Operationalizing the Correction Factor; Those opposing the correction factor might assert the infeasibility of mitigating inequities during a pandemic.[14] Yet one large US health system successfully applied similar criteria in allocating remdesivir[15] and the National Academy of Medicine endorsed disparity-mitigating criteria for allocating scarce vaccines.[16] Applying the correction factor is neither time nor resource intensive. It will not divert resources from the goal of treating illness and reducing morbidity. With the data available about COVID-19’s disproportionate impact, not applying an available tool to lessen inequities is an abrogation of ethical duty.; One utilitarian argument asserts that we will save fewer lives if the prioritized patients are more likely to die despite interventions. Yet society bears responsibility for the social policies that created the disparities. Thus, there is an obligation to mitigate those societal problems, even when doing so might save fewer lives.[17]; Some clinicians argue that they should have discretion in determining triage scores. This objection to the correction factor in formulating triage procedures reflects the conflict between clinical and public health ethics. Implementing a CSC protocol shifts decision-making from the clinician to a triage committee and from an individual focus to a community focus. Allowing clinicians to determine triage protocols would increase the risk of decisions based on bias and subjectivity.; Another open question is whether the correction factor will achieve the intended goal. Nancy Kass suggests that without evidence to support the effectiveness, we cannot ethically implement the policy.[18] Thus, applying the Kass analysis, diverting a scarce resource to someone less likely to survive should require proof that doing so systematically would resolve or improve structural inequity.  There is limited empirical evidence, but we may proceed with caution based on the presumptive data and the hypothesis that a triage allocation that uses a correction factor could help. Computer-based modeling or “tabletop” exercises applying the framework to actual patients but not enacting the protocols could assess the possible effects of the protocols.[19]   ; Perhaps the most robust rebuttal in response to the opposition of applying a correction factor is in an argument proffered by Douglas White that no reasonable triage framework maximizes health outcomes if it creates significant inequalities.[20]  White’s argument emphasizes the importance of addressing inequity.; lll.     A More Robust Version of the Correction Factor; The burdens associated with any public health intervention typically fall into three categories:[21] privacy and confidentiality, risk to liberty and self-determination, and justice. Most burdens associated with allocating scarce resources fall under the justice category.; I not only disagree with the arguments against using a correction factor, but I also argue that the correction factor does not go far enough. First, using the ADI neglects consideration of people of color disproportionately affected by COVID-19 no longer living in a neighborhood with the highest ADI scores. Based on new research, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores are also potentially discriminatory and not ideal for addressing structural inequity, racism, or ethnic discrimination in the triage setting, although they are applied to triage.[22] Second, public hospitals in socioeconomically depressed communities and rural locations may serve a population in which nearly the entire community will have ADI scores that qualify for application of the correction factor.; lV.     Relying on ADI cannot protect all people disadvantaged due to their race or ethnicity; The ADI uses seventeen measures of socioeconomic disadvantage. Some racial inequality in healthcare is unrelated to socioeconomic status and can be missed by ADI. Racial inequality in healthcare may be directly related to implicit and explicit bias and past and current discrimination. But the correction factor will not help the Black patient not currently residing in a highly disadvantaged neighborhood or experiencing other vestiges of racism in the form of socioeconomic disadvantage. A correction factor that uses more information than ADI could make up for some of the weaknesses of SOFA as well.; V.     When all patients have high ADI Scores; What happens when triaging occurs in hospitals serving populations where almost all patients have ADI scores of 8 to 10?  To illustrate, I will use the example of Belle Glade, Florida, in western Palm Beach County.[23] The overwhelming majority of the neighborhoods served by the one public hospital, Lakeside Medical Center, is at a level 10 state decile, with a few neighborhoods at 8 and 9 state decile.[24] During a surge in that hospital, the correction factor will apply to every patient. The hospital must then resort to other considerations, such as random allocation. This potential dilemma suggests the need to consider further steps, such as load balancing, to lessen the inequities. ; Vl.     Load Balancing; Load balancing is a plan in which hospitals report daily census and available beds. Patients are diverted or transferred to hospitals with open beds when one hospital is at maximum capacity. Although identified as a method to avoid the need for triaging, I suggest load balancing is also equity balancing, especially when the overwhelmed hospital is in a high ADI area.; Failures in load balancing exacerbate the harm to disadvantaged populations. Disadvantaged individuals are more likely to seek treatment in hospitals with limited ability to increase capacity or care for many critically ill patients. During surges in COVID-19, hospitals in poor neighborhoods were overrun by admissions and lacked resources to treat, while nearby private hospitals had available beds and resources.[25]; The Arizona Department of Health Services developed an effective load-balancing system to coordinate the statewide transfer of patients from overloaded hospitals to other hospitals.[26] The system dramatically improved access to care for people of color and rural populations.[27]; One of the state’s foremost responsibilities is safeguarding the health and well-being of people threatened when health systems fail to cooperate. Voluntary load balancing is preferable, but if the healthcare systems are unwilling to cooperate and if voluntary efforts are ineffective, state governments should intervene and require private hospitals to take part in load balancing. When needed, public health officials should issue emergency orders to require hospitals to participate in load-balancing efforts, including accepting patient transfers that are not part of their covered population.  ; CONCLUSION        ; Rawls’s difference principle, Daniels’s equality of opportunity, Parfit’s deontic egalitarianism, and Harris’s double jeopardy argument all justify and may even compel using the correction factor. COVID-19 turned academic and hypothetical discussions and debates about allocating scarce resources and making untenable choices of who lives and who dies to real-life responsibilities. Once hospitals move to a crisis standard of care, they may need to allocate scarce resources, so having systems in place that can compensate for past inequities and improve fairness in access to care is the ethical imperative. Dismantling structural inequities and reassessing allocation protocols should incorporate the correction factor as a new foundational framework and then build on it using load balancing and exercising caution if applying SOFA. It is an ethical responsibility to use these tools to dismantle the pervasive structural inequities when allocating scarce resources.; -; [1] Goldberg, Daniel S. “Against the Medicalization of Public Health (Ethics).” Public Health Ethics 14, no. 2 (2021): 117–19. https://doi.org/10.1093/phe/phab024.; [2] Morrissey, Mary Beth, and Jorge L.

However, due to the nature of such deep black-boxed models, concerns about interpretability, fairness, and biases in healthcare scenarios where human lives are at stake call for a careful and thorough examination of both datasets and models. In this work, we focus on MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version IV), the largest publicly available healthcare dataset, and conduct comprehensive analyses of interpretability as well as dataset representation bias and prediction fairness of deep learning models for in-hospital mortality prediction. First, we analyze the interpretability of deep learning mortality prediction models and observe that (1) the best-performing interpretability method successfully identifies critical features for mortality prediction on various prediction models as well as recognizing new important features that domain knowledge does not consider; (2) prediction models rely on demographic features, raising concerns in fairness. Therefore, we then evaluate the fairness of models and do observe the unfairness: (1) there exists disparate treatment in prescribing mechanical ventilation among patient groups across ethnicity, gender and age; (2) models often rely on racial attributes unequally across subgroups to generate their predictions. We further draw concrete connections between interpretability methods and fairness metrics by showing how feature importance from interpretability methods can be beneficial in quantifying potential disparities in mortality predictors. Our analysis demonstrates that the prediction performance is not the only factor to consider when evaluating models for healthcare applications, since high prediction performance might be the result of unfair utilization of demographic features. Our findings suggest that future research in AI models for healthcare applications can benefit from utilizing the analysis workflow of interpretability and fairness as well as verifying if models achieve superior performance at the cost of introducing bias.",Interpretability; Machine learning; Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Health care; Representation (politics); Predictive modelling; Feature (linguistics); Data science; Linguistics; Philosophy; Politics; Political science; Law; Economics; Economic growth,,Benchmarking; Critical Care; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Hospital Mortality; Humans,10.1038/s41598-022-11012-2,true
023-010-282-565-361,Does one workshop on respecting cultural differences increase health professionals' confidence to improve the care of Australian Aboriginal patients with cancer? An evaluation.,2017,journal article,BMC health services research,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,United Kingdom,Angela Durey; Georgia Halkett; Melissa Berg; Leanne Lester; Marion Kickett,"Aboriginal Australians have worse cancer survival rates than other Australians. Reasons include fear of a cancer diagnosis, reluctance to attend mainstream health services and discrimination from health professionals. Offering health professionals education in care focusing on Aboriginal patients’ needs is important. The aim of this paper was to evaluate whether participating in a workshop improved the confidence of radiation oncology health professionals in their knowledge, communication and ability to offer culturally safe healthcare to Aboriginal Australians with cancer. Mixed methods using pre and post workshop online surveys, and one delivered 2 months later, were evaluated. Statistical analysis determined the relative proportion of participants who changed from not at all/a little confident at baseline to fairly/extremely confident immediately and 2 months after the workshop. Factor analysis identified underlying dimensions in the items and nonparametric tests recorded changes in mean dimension scores over and between times. Qualitative data was analysed for emerging themes. Fifty-nine participants attended the workshops, 39 (66% response rate) completed pre-workshop surveys, 32 (82% of study participants) completed post-workshop surveys and 25 (64% of study participants) completed surveys 2 months later. A significant increase in the proportion of attendees who reported fair/extreme confidence within 2 days of the workshop was found in nine of 14 items, which was sustained for all but one item 2 months later. Two additional items had a significant increase in the proportion of fair/extremely confident attendees 2 months post workshop compared to baseline. An exploratory factor analysis identified three dimensions: communication; relationships; and awareness. All dimensions’ mean scores significantly improved within 2 days (p < 0.005) and persisted to 2 months. The workshop raised awareness about barriers and enablers to delivering services respectful of cultural differences, led to a willingness to reflect on pre-existing beliefs and assumptions about Aboriginal Australians that in some cases resulted in improved care. Single workshops co-delivered by an Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal presenter can be effective in building health professionals’ confidence and translating into practice knowledge of respectful care of Aboriginal patients with cancer. Sustaining improvements may require integrating this approach into ongoing professional development.",Cultural diversity; Health administration; Public health; Health informatics; Health care; Exploratory factor analysis; Response rate (survey); Family medicine; Nursing research; Medicine,Aboriginal people; Cancer; Cultural differences; Education; Health professional; Mixed-methods,Awareness; Communication; Culturally Competent Care/standards; Delivery of Health Care/standards; Female; Health Personnel/standards; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander/ethnology; Neoplasms/ethnology; Prejudice/prevention & control; Quality Improvement; Queensland/ethnology; Surveys and Questionnaires,10.1186/s12913-017-2599-z,true

Without triage, there is a risk that patients will be admitted to the ICU in the sequence that they present, disadvantaging those who either present later or have poorer access to healthcare. Moreover, if the patients with the best prognosis are not allocated life support, there is the possibility that overall mortality will increase. Before formulating criteria, principles such as maximizing lives saved and fairness ought to have been agreed upon to guide decision-making. The triage process is subdivided into three parts, i.e., having explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria for ICU admission, prioritization of patients for allocation to available beds, and periodic reassessment of all patients already admitted to the ICU. Multi-dimensional criteria offer more holistic prognostication than only using age cutoffs. Appointed triage officers should also be enabled to make data-driven decisions. However, the process does not merely end with an allocation decision being made. Any decision has to be sensitively and transparently communicated to the patient and family. With infection control measures, there are challenges in managing communication and the psychosocial distress of dying alone. Therefore, explicit video call protocols and social services expertise will be necessary to mitigate these challenges. Besides symptom management and psychosocial management, supportive care teams play an integral role in coordination of complex cases. This scoping review found support for the three-pronged, triage-communication-supportive care approach to facilitate the smooth operationalization of the triage process in a pandemic.",Distress; Psychosocial; Health care; Intensive care unit; Triage; Life support; Social Welfare; Medical emergency; Medicine; Operationalization,COVID-19; Communication; Ethics; Intensive care unit; Pandemic surge; Supportive care; Triage,,10.1186/s40560-020-00475-y,true

The World Health Organisation has recommended use of the partogram to monitor labour and delivery in order to improve healthcare and reduce maternal and foetal mortality rates. Objective: This study described factors affecting utilisation of the partogram among nurses and midwives in selected health facilities of Rwanda. Method: A descriptive quantitative and cross-sectional research design was used. The population comprised 131 nurses and midwives providing obstetric care in 15 health institutions (1 hospital and 14 health centres). Data collection was through a self-administered questionnaire, and a pre-test of the data collection instrument was carried out to enhance validity and reliability. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (version 21) was used to capture and analyse data. Ethical clearance was obtained from the University of the Western Cape (Republic of South Africa) and from the Institutional Review Board of Kigali Health Institute (Rwanda). Patricia Benner’s model of nursing practice was used to guide the study. Results: It was found that 36.6% of nurses and midwives did not receive any in-service training on how to manage women in labour. Despite fair knowledge of the partogram among nurses and midwives in this study, only 41.22% reported having used the partogram properly, while 58.78% reported not having done so. Conclusion: Nurses’ and midwives’ years of professional experience and training in managing pregnant women in labour were found to be predictors of the likelihood of proper use of the partogram. In-service training of obstetric caregivers in the Eastern Province of Rwanda is recommended to improve use of the partogram while managing women in labour.",Cross-sectional study; Nursing; Health care; Partogram; Institutional review board; Research design; Childbirth; Complications of pregnancy; Population; Medicine,,"Adult; Clinical Competence/standards; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fetal Monitoring/instrumentation; Humans; Logistic Models; Maternal Mortality/trends; Monitoring, Physiologic/instrumentation; Multivariate Analysis; Nurse Midwives/standards; Nurses/standards; Pregnancy; Rwanda; Surveys and Questionnaires",10.4102/curationis.v40i1.1751,true

However, HCV testing was inconsistently implemented among PLHWUD. The low infection awareness and mental health challenges together impede PLHWUD's treatment-seeking. The study used baseline data of a randomized controlled trial conducted in Vietnam. HCV infection status was collected through self-report and medical record review. A linear mixed-effects regression model was used to examine the relationships between PLHWUD's perceived barriers to seeking healthcare, their depressive symptoms, and the consistencies in HCV status reports. Among the 181 PLHWUD in the study, one-third (64; 35.4%) had inconsistent self-reports and medical records of HIV infection status. The agreement between the two records was fair (Kappa statistics = 0.43). PLHWUD with consistent HCV infection confirmed by both medical records and self-reports perceived lower levels of healthcare-seeking barriers than those with discrepant HCV reports (estimated difference = -1.59, SE = 0.71, P = 0.027). Depressive symptoms were significantly correlated with healthcare-seeking barriers among those with discrepant HCV results (estimate = 0.17, SE = 0.06, P = 0.007).

Forman-Hoffman; Emily McClure; Joni McKeeman; Charles T. Wood; Jennifer Cook Middleton; Asheley Cockrell Skinner; Eliana M. Perrin; Meera Viswanathan,"Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common among children and adolescents and is associated with functional impairment and suicide. Purpose To update the 2009 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) systematic review on screening for and treatment of MDD in children and adolescents in primary care settings. Data sources Several electronic searches (May 2007 to February 2015) and searches of reference lists of published literature. Study selection Trials and recent systematic reviews of treatment, test-retest studies of screening, and trials and large cohort studies for harms. Data extraction Data were abstracted by 1 investigator and checked by another; 2 investigators independently assessed study quality. Data synthesis Limited evidence from 5 studies showed that such tools as the Beck Depression Inventory and Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents had reasonable accuracy for identifying MDD among adolescents in primary care settings. Six trials evaluated treatment. Several individual fair- and good-quality studies of fluoxetine, combined fluoxetine and cognitive behavioral therapy, escitalopram, and collaborative care demonstrated benefits of treatment among adolescents, with no associated harms. Limitation The review included only English-language studies, narrow inclusion criteria focused only on MDD, high thresholds for quality, potential publication bias, limited data on harms, and sparse evidence on long-term outcomes of screening and treatment among children younger than 12 years. Conclusion No evidence was found of a direct link between screening children and adolescents for MDD in primary care or similar settings and depression or other health-related outcomes. Evidence showed that some screening tools are accurate and some treatments are beneficial among adolescents (but not younger children), with no evidence of associated harms.

In WSNs, the sensor nodes are scattered over the target area to acquire the data from the environment and transmit it to  the  base  station  via  single  or  multi-hop  communication. Due to the sensor nodes' constrained battery, the sensor nodes near the base station are more involved in data transmissions. These relay nodes drain more energy and die soon, leading to a hotspot/energy-hole problem.  Several algorithms have been proposed  in  the  literature  to  address  the  hotspot  problem using   the   mobile   sink.   However,   most   of   the   existing approaches are highlycomputational and also provide a static solutiononly. In this context, we proposed an energy-efficient dynamic    mobile    sink    path    construction    with    low computational complexity for data acquisition in WSNs. We use the minimum spanning tree-based clustering for selecting the data collection     points     and     a     computational geometry-based  method  to  identify  the  visiting  order  of  the data collection points by the mobile sink.

Falvey; Edward Hess; Cari Levy; Eugene Nuccio; Anna E. Barón; Frederick A. Masoudi; Jennifer E. Stevens-Lapsley,"Objective To use patient-level clinical variables to develop and validate a parsimonious model to predict hospital readmissions from home healthcare (HHC) in Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Design Retrospective analysis using multivariable logistic regression and gradient boosting machine (GBM) learning to develop and validate a predictive model. Setting/participants/meaurements A 5% national sample of patients, aged 65 years or older, with Medicare fee-for-service who received skilled HHC services within 5 days of hospital discharge in 2012 (n = 43 407). Multiple data sets were merged, including Medicare Outcome and Assessment Information Set, Home Health Claims, Medicare Provider Analysis and Review, and Master Beneficiary Summary Files, to extract patient-level variables from the first HHC visit after discharge and measure 30-day readmission outcomes. Results Among 43 407 patients with inpatient hospitalizations followed by HHC, 14.7% were readmitted within 30 days. Of the 53 candidate variables, seven remained in the final model as individually predictive of outcome: Elixhauser comorbidity index, index hospital length of stay, urinary catheter presence, patient status (ie, fragile health with high risk of complications or serious progressive condition), two or more hospitalizations in prior year, pressure injury risk or presence, and surgical wound presence. Of interest, surgical wounds, either from a total hip or total knee arthroplasty procedure or another surgical procedure, were associated with fewer readmissions. The optimism-corrected c-statistics for the full model and parsimonious model were 0.67 and 0.66, respectively, indicating fair discrimination. The Brier score for both models was 0.120, indicating good calibration. The GBM model identified similar predictive variables. Conclusion Variables available to HHC clinicians at the first postdischarge HHC visit can predict readmission risk and inform care plans in HHC. Future analyses incorporating measures of social determinants of health, such as housing instability or social support, have the potential to enhance prediction of this outcome.

Study demonstrated a high prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use in private aged care facilities. There is a strong need for medication review in the private healthcare system in Malaysia to ensure pharmaceutical safety and effectiveness. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude and practice of private hospital pharmacists on medication review service in Malaysia. Method: This cross-sectional study was carried out from October to November 2020 using an online questionnaire. Private hospital pharmacists in Malaysia were invited to participate in a validated 36-items questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis H test were performed to analyse the data. Results: Survey questionnaires were completed by 104 private hospital pharmacists. 80 pharmacists (76.9%) presented with a high level of knowledge of medication review, while 92 pharmacists (88.5%) had a positive attitude. Approximately two-third (n = 68, 65.4%) was providing medication review in the pharmacy, whereas 45 of them (43.3%) did not obtain patient’s medication history at the time of admission or as early as possible. Besides, only 69 of the participants (66.3%) reconciled patient’s own medication with the prescribed medicines. Factors associated significantly with practice of medication review include age (p = 0.010) and years of experience as a private hospital pharmacist (p = 0.016). Three major perceived challenges of implementing medication review were lack of time (82.7%), insufficient training (79.8%) and lack of manpower (60.6%). Conclusion: In conclusion, private hospital pharmacists in Malaysia have high level of knowledge, a positive attitude and a fair practice regarding medication review service.

M. Khan; Ziaul Islam,"Background; National healthcare financing strategy recommends tax-based equity funds and insurance schemes for the poor and extreme poor living in urban slums and pavements as the majority of these population utilise informal providers resulting in adverse health effects and financial hardship. We assessed the effect of a health voucher scheme (HVS) and micro-health insurance (MHI) scheme on healthcare utilisation and out-of-pocket (OOP) payments and the cost of implementing such schemes.; ; Methods; HVS and MHI schemes were implemented by Concern Worldwide through selected NGO health centres, referral hospitals, and private healthcare facilities in three City Corporations of Bangladesh from December 2016 to March 2020. A household survey with 1,294 enrolees, key-informant interviews, focus group discussions, consultative meetings, and document reviews were conducted for extracting data on healthcare utilisation, OOP payments, views of enrolees, and suggestions of implementers, and costs of services at the point of care.; ; Results; Healthcare utilisation including maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH) services, particularly from medically trained providers, was higher and OOP payments were lower among the scheme enrolees compared to corresponding population groups in general. The beneficiaries were happy with their access to healthcare, especially for MNCH services, and their perceived quality of care was fair enough. They, however, suggested expanding the benefits package, supported by an additional workforce. The cost per beneficiary household for providing services per year was €32 in HVS and €15 in MHI scheme.; ; Conclusion; HVS and MHI schemes enabled higher healthcare utilisation at lower OOP payments among the enrolees, who were happy with their access to healthcare, particularly for MNCH services. However, they suggested a larger benefits package in future. The provider’s costs of the schemes were reasonable; however, there are potentials of cost containment by purchasing the health services for their beneficiaries in a competitive basis from the market.

Fairness in financial contribution and protection against financial risk is based on the notion that every household should pay a fair share. Health policy makers have long been concerned with protecting people from the possibility that ill health will lead to catastrophic financial payments and subsequent impoverishment. A number of studies on health care financing equity have been conducted in some provinces of China, but in Guangxi, we found such observation is not enough. What is the situation in Guagnxi? A research on rural areas of Guangxi can add knowledge in this field and help improve the equity and efficiency of health financing, particularly in low-income citizens in rural countries, is a major concern in China’s medical sector reform. Socio-economic characteristics and healthcare payment data were obtained from two rounds of household surveys conducted in 2009 (4634 respondents) and 2013 (3951 respondents). The contributions of funding sources were determined and a progressivity analysis of government healthcare subsidies was performed. Household consumption expenditure and total healthcare payments were calculated and incidence and intensity of catastrophic health payments were measured. Summary indices (concentration index, Kakwani index and Gini coefficient) were obtained for the sources of healthcare financing: indirect taxes, out of pocket payments, and social insurance contributions. The overall health-care financing system was regressive. In 2013, the Kakwani index was 0.0013, the vertical effect of all the three funding sources was 0.0001, and some values exceeded 100%, indicating that vertical inequity had a large influence on causing total health financing inequity. The headcount of catastrophic health payment declined sharply between 2009 and 2013, using total expenditure (from 7.3% to 1.2%) or non-food expenditure (from 26.1% to 7.5%) as the indicator of household capacity to pay. Our study demonstrates an inequitable distribution of government healthcare subsidies in China from 2009 to 2013, and the inequity was reduced, especially in rural areas.

Gallagher; M. E. Kelly; E. Hoti,"Background Acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) is a common disease across the world and is associated with significant socioeconomic costs. Although contemporary guidelines support the role of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC), there is significant variation among units adopting it as standard practice. There are many resource implications of providing a service whereby cholecystectomies for acute cholecystitis can be performed safely. Methods Studies that incorporated an economic analysis comparing early with delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) for acute cholecystitis were identified by means of a systematic review. A meta-analysis was performed on those cost evaluations. The quality of economic valuations contained therein was evaluated using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) analysis score. Results Six studies containing cost analyses were included in the meta-analysis with 1128 patients. The median healthcare cost of ELC versus DLC was €4400 and €6004 respectively. Five studies had adequate data for pooled analysis. The standardized mean difference between ELC and DLC was -2·18 (95 per cent c.i. -3·86 to -0·51; P = 0·011; I 2 = 98·7 per cent) in favour of ELC.

It is one of the few countries with a strategic plan for health promotion implementation. Given the paucity of understanding in relation to the concept of a health promoting prison, this study assessed routinely collected prison inspection data to understand and distil learning in regard the practical implementation of health-promoting prisons. Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland (HMIPS) oversees the independent inspection of all prisons. This desk-based study analysed openly accessible inspection reports from a public repository. The sample was limited to inspection reports using the 2018 revised Standards to ensure comparability between reports. Eight unique inspection reports meeting this criterion were downloaded between January and October 2020. The prisons had their inspections undertaken between May 2018 and January 2020. Data from the reports which focused on ‘health and wellbeing’ were inductively coded using NVivo 12 to support thematic analysis. Results are presented against the values and principles outlined in the SPS’ own framework for promoting health in prison. All of the institution reports contained evidence of fairness and justice in their prison and understandings of health inequalities were recognised by staff. There were also examples of mutual (peer) support between people in prison; good relationships between staff and prisoners; and strong health promotion leadership. Conversely, some environmental conditions hindered the development of health promotion – this included staffing shortages and some practices fostering health inequity. Even where a prison was reported as having health promotion activities in place these were focused on a narrow range of individual risk factors such as smoking cessation or substance misuse. Far less attention was paid to wider health determinants. Scotland has been at the forefront of attempts to embed a health promoting prison philosophy in their justice system. Inspection data focusing on ‘health and wellbeing’ were analysed, but the analysis suggests that more could be done to ensure a health promoting setting. The way prisons inspectors are assessing health and wellbeing in particular areas is very narrow, with the focus exclusively on healthcare without a wider appreciation of how other areas of prison life can impact.",Health administration; Public health; Health informatics; Health care; Health promotion; Health equity; Prison; Public relations; Nursing research; Medicine,,Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Prisoners; Prisons; Scotland; Smoking Cessation,10.1186/s12913-021-06337-z,true

To sustain the response towards the pandemic, many hospitals have adapted to virtual healthcare and telemedicine. Google™ has become the most widely used search engine over the years. Google Trends™ can be used to depict the public interest over a certain topic. The output of the Google Trends™ is displayed as relative search volume (RSV) which is the proportionate search volume regarding a specific topic comparative to the total search volume in a specific time and region. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the daily reported number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths and the corresponding changes in Google Trends™ RSV of telehealth over six months. Methods A retrospective study was conducted from January 21, 2020 to July 21, 2020. About 17 countries that reported the total number of cases greater than 200,000 in the situation report of July 21, 2020 were selected to be a part of this study. The daily reported new cases and deaths globally and of the selected countries were extracted from the World Health Organization (WHO) situation reports. The combination of keywords used for obtaining the RSV data through Google Trends™ was ""telehealth"", ""telemedicine"", ""mHealth"", and ""eHealth"". These words were used with the ""+"" feature of Google Trends™ with ""1/21/2020 to 7/21/2020"" as time range, ""all categories"" for the category, and ""web search"" for the type of search. The worldwide RSV as well as the RSVs of the selected countries were obtained from the Google Trends™ website. Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ) was used to determine the strength of the relationship between new cases or deaths and RSVs related to telehealth. Results A positive fair correlation was established between the global interest in telehealth and the new cases (ρ=0.307, p-value<0.001) and deaths (ρ=0.469, p-value<0.001) reported worldwide. The United States of America (USA), India, and Bangladesh were found to have a positive fair correlation between the public interest regarding telehealth and the emerging new COVID-19 cases and deaths. The United Kingdom (UK) and Italy demonstrated a positive poor correlation between the rising new cases or deaths and RSV. Similar statistics were noted for the daily new cases of Chile. For Turkey, a positive fair correlation between new deaths and RSV while a positive poor correlation between new cases and RSV was observed. No significant correlation was observed for the rest of the selected countries. Conclusion This study highlights the steadily rising public interest in telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine can provide the necessary remote consultation and healthcare for patients in the current situation. However, previous studies have shown that the majority of the countries are inadequately equipped for the digitization of the healthcare system. Therefore, it has become necessary to incorporate telemedicine into the healthcare system to combat any possible pandemic in the future.",eHealth; Public health surveillance; mHealth; Infodemiology; Telemedicine; Telehealth; Global health; Family medicine; Medicine; Pandemic,coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19); global health; google trends; infodemiology; pandemic; public health surveillance; telehealth; telemedicine,,10.7759/cureus.10487,true

Household interviews, a group oral history and interviews with NGOs working with Maasai communities, contributed to the data analysed. Inductive thematic analysis was used to understand healthcare experiences within a framework of cultural safety and ethical space. Despite trust in biomedicine, Maasai people have a strong desire for health services with particular characteristics. Quality of care, including facilities and diagnostics available and used, was important. A sense of fairness was a determinant in respecting services including 'first come first serve' system and transparency when unable to treat a condition. Trust in health services was also influenced by personal interactions with health workers, including provision of health information provided to patients and instances of being mistreated. These findings offer an understanding of ways in which spaces of healthcare can be more approachable and trusted by Maasai. Incorporating cultural safety and ethical spaces to understand healthcare access can help to reduce the power imbalance possibly resulting from a history of marginalisation. This can inform development of culturally appropriate programmes, used to educate healthcare professionals and advocate for improved healthcare services for marginalised groups.",Maasai; Health care; Tanzania; Thematic analysis; Public relations; Sociology; Politics; Qualitative research; Medicine; Political science; Socioeconomics; Social science; Law,Health services research; Public Health; Qualitative study,Humans; Tanzania; Health Facilities; Health Services Accessibility; Health Personnel; Health Services,10.1136/bmjgh-2022-009907,true

Existing code set engineering methods pose significant limitations when considering reproducible research. To improve the transparency and reusability of research, these code sets must abide by FAIR principles; this is not currently happening. We propose ‘term sets’, an equivalent alternative to code sets that are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.; ; ; Materials and methods ; We describe a new code set representation, consisting of natural language inclusion and exclusion terms (term sets), and explain its relationship to code sets. We formally prove that any code set has a corresponding term set. We demonstrate utility by searching for recently published code sets, representing them as term sets, and reporting on the number of inclusion and exclusion terms compared with the size of the code set.; ; ; Results ; Thirty-one code sets from 20 papers covering diverse disease domains were converted into term sets. The term sets were on average 74% the size of their equivalent original code set. Four term sets were larger due to deficiencies in the original code sets.; ; ; Discussion ; Term sets can concisely represent any code set. This may reduce barriers for examining and reusing code sets, which may accelerate research using healthcare databases. We have developed open-source software that supports researchers using term sets.; ; ; Conclusion ; Term sets are independent of clinical code terminologies and therefore: enable reproducible research; are resistant to terminology changes; and are less error-prone as they are shorter than the equivalent code set.",Set (abstract data type); Natural language; Code (set theory); Software; Computer science; Representation (mathematics); Term (time); Theoretical computer science; Transparency (human–computer interaction),,"Clinical Coding; Databases, Factual; Electronic Health Records; Software",10.1371/journal.pone.0212291,true

Producing and applying robust genomics knowledge is a complex endeavour in which no single individual, profession, discipline or community holds all the answers.  Engagement and involvement of diverse stakeholders can support alignment of societal and scientific interests, understandings and perspectives and promises better science and fairer outcomes. In this context we argue for F.A.I.R.E.R. data and data use that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible, Equitable and Responsible. Yet there is a paucity of international guidance on how to engage publics, patients and participants in genomics. To support meaningful and effective engagement and involvement we developed an Engagement Framework for involving and engaging participants, patients and publics in genomics research and health implementation . ; The Engagement Framework is intended to support all those working in genomics research, medicine, and healthcare to deliberatively consider approaches to participant, patient and public engagement and involvement in their work. Through a series of questions, the Engagement Framework prompts new ways of thinking about the aims and purposes of engagement, and support reflection on the strengths, limitations, likely outcomes and impacts of choosing different approaches to engagement. To guide genomics activities, we describe four themes and associated questions for deliberative reflection: (i) fairness; (ii) context; (iii) heterogeneity, and (iv) recognising tensions and conflict. ; The four key components in the Engagement provide a framework to assist those involved in genomics to reflect on decisions they make for their initiatives, including the strategies selected, the participant, patient and public stakeholders engaged, and the anticipated goals. The Engagement Framework is one step in an actively evolving process of building genomics research and implementation cultures which foster responsible leadership and are attentive to objectives which increase equality, diversity and inclusion in participation and outcomes.",Sociology; Inclusion (education); Health care; Reciprocity (social psychology); Public engagement; Quality (business); Context (language use); Diversity (politics); Public relations; Process (engineering),Diversity and Inclusion; Fairness; Reciprocity; Collaboration; Global; Quality.; Engagement and involvement; Genomics; Trust; Equality,,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.17233.1,true

In this paper, we provide estimates on the determinants of OOPE in Italy by using data coming from an observational cross-sectional study that enrolled a sample of 2526 patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases. We explore the association between OOPE and: (1) geographical location; (2) income effects; (3) performances in delivering healthcare. A regression model was used. Individuals' age were in the range of 18-88 (mean 44 ± 14.55). Forty-six percent were females, 54% were married and 19% held a bachelor degree. Ninety-six percent of respondents declared an OOPE >0 whose mean value was €960 ± €950. Individuals belonging to low-income and low-performance regions were more likely to declare an OOPE >0 (99%). Regression findings suggest that increases in OOPE could be considered as a response from patients aiming to compensate for lacks and inefficiencies in the public healthcare offers. Policymakers should consider increases in OOPE in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs) as an indicator of poor quality of care and poor fairness.",Demography; Regression analysis; Health care; Health technology; Observational study; Bachelor degree; Poor quality; Sample (statistics); Location; Medicine,IBD; equity and quality of care; out of pocket expenditure,Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Expenditures; Humans; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/economics; Italy/epidemiology; Male; State Medicine; Surveys and Questionnaires,10.3390/ijerph17218156,true

The English health-care-associated infection quality indicator system was one of the earliest in the world to mandate the collection and public reporting of such data and has been associated with a reduction of MRSA bacteraemias and Clostridium difficile infections but has shown mixed results for other infections. Diagnostic laboratory data vary greatly between hospitals depending not only on the underlying frequency of the infection of interest, but on the case mix, numbers of samples processed and laboratory factors, which limits benchmarking. Further, over-reliance on laboratory reports has led to unintended negative consequences in England.

Brown; Tiffany B. Kindratt; Godfred O. Boateng; Grace Ellen Brannon,"Patient perceptions of healthcare ratings, diabetes self-efficacy, and diabetes management play a role in diabetes-related outcomes, particularly among women of childbearing age. Guided by a modified Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior framework, the objective was to compare differences in perceptions of health care ratings, diabetes self-efficacy, and diabetes management among non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White women of childbearing age. The sample comprised 7 years (2012–2018) of Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data. The sample was limited to women of childbearing age (18–45 years) who have ever been told they had diabetes (n = 691; weighted n = 932,426). Dependent variables were health care rating, diabetes self-efficacy, and diabetes care management. The key independent variable was race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic White). We adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and perceived health status using multiple linear and multivariable logistic regressions. Non-Hispanic Black women (41.6%) self-reported their health status as fair or poor (44.9%) compared to non-Hispanic White (33.3%) and Hispanic (37.6%). In adjusted models, non-Hispanic Black women had 46% lower odds (95% CI = 0.31, 0.94) of reporting high health care ratings compared to non-Hispanic White women. Non-Hispanic Black women had 43% lower odds (95% CI = 0.35, 0.95) and Hispanic women had 47% lower odds (95% CI = 0.34, 0.80) of reporting higher levels of diabetes care management than non-Hispanic White women.

Vale; Dane Hill; Steven R. Feldman,"Actinic keratosis is one of the most common dermatological diagnoses worldwide, especially among the elderly, fair-skinned, and immunocompromised, and is associated with a risk of transformation to skin cancer. With actinic keratosis and skin cancer prevalence increasing as the aged population expands in the US, optimizing treatment strategies may produce cost savings for the healthcare system. Since the time of our last review in 2008, investigation of the economic considerations in treating actinic keratosis has advanced. To provide an update of treatment cost effectiveness and to review factors relating to the costs of care, we conducted a systematic review of pharmacoeconomic publications since December 2008. We identified 11 pharmacoeconomic studies, with one cost-of-treatment, five cost-effectiveness, and five cost-utility analyses. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was well tolerated and produced a favorable cosmetic outcome in most studies. Ingenol mebutate, the newest but most expensive topical field therapy, 5-fluorouracil, and PDT were the most cost-effective treatments in our review. Patient adherence to therapy and the management of adverse effects were significant contributors to treatment costs. In the US, treatment guidelines and formalized cost-effectiveness analyses for actinic keratosis are absent from the recent literature. Future pharmacoeconomic investigation will depend on up-to-date comparative efficacy data, as well as clarification of rates of, and management strategies for, adverse effects, therapeutic non-adherence, and lesion recurrence.",Health administration; Dermatology; Adverse effect; Skin cancer; Ingenol mebutate; Actinic keratosis; Keratosis; MEDLINE; Health economics; Medicine,,"Aged; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Dermatologic Agents/administration & dosage; Economics, Pharmaceutical; Humans; Keratosis, Actinic/complications; Medication Adherence; Photochemotherapy/adverse effects; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Risk Factors; Skin Neoplasms/etiology",10.1007/s40273-016-0462-4,false

In Ethiopia, wide variation and lower achievement exists in outpatient visit per person per year against the target to reach by 2020. Therefore, this study is aimed at measuring inequalities and inequities in outpatient care utilization in Ethiopia. Methods The study utilized data from 2015/16 Ethiopian National Health Account survey. The analysis included a weighted sample of 42,460 individuals. Concentration curve and indices were used to measure inequality in outpatient care utilization. Deviations in the degree to which outpatient care was distributed according to need were measured by the horizontal inequity index. All statistical analyses were done using STATA version 14. In all analyses statistical significance was declared at a p-value < 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval. Results The outpatient care utilizations were found to be concentrated among the rich. The actual (C = 0.0335, 95% CI: 0.0298, 0.0431) and need predicted (C = 0.0157, 95% CI: 0.0117, 0.0413) utilizations were concentrated among the rich. The distributions of outpatient care in Ethiopians were pro-rich (rich-favoring). The decomposition analysis revealed that need factors were the main positive contributors to the inequality (23.6%) and non-need factors were among the negative contributors to the inequality (-48.4%).

Rooney,"Muslim women of child-bearing age make up a fair part of the UK society, however, literature addressing their health needs or experiences of health services have not been extensively researched. The term ‘Muslim’ is often combined with ethnic group identity, rather than used to refer to people distinguished by beliefs or affiliations. Muslim women commonly observe certain religious and cultural practices during their maternity journey. The little research there is in this area suggests that more could be done from a service provision perspective to support Muslim women through this significant life event. The aim of this study was to investigate Muslim women’s perceived needs and the factors that influence their health seeking decisions when engaging with maternity services located in North-West of England. The study used longitudinal semi-structured interviews with seven English-speaking first-time pregnant Muslim women receiving maternity care in North-West of England. Total of 21 interview; each woman was interviewed during the antenatal (29 to 40 weeks of pregnancy), immediate postnatal (within the first 2 months after birth) and later postnatal (4 months after birth) period. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed using Braun & Clark (2006) as a guide to forming a systematic approach to handling raw data. Muslim women associated most aspects of the maternity journey with their religious beliefs. Religion was not the primary reason for them becoming pregnant, yet it was an aspiration for them becoming mothers. Emerging themes include: 1) a spiritual perspective; 2) expression of religious requirements; 3) perceptions of healthcare professionals. Religious values and practices provided a positive resource for women during their maternity journey. They described how healthcare professionals approached their needs, while highlighting their concerns of the negative presentation of Muslims in Western media. Muslim women need to feel confident to express their needs within a maternity setting. Lack of awareness amongst healthcare professionals around religious values and how Muslim women may feel when expressing their needs can inhibit them getting optimal care that acknowledges their needs. The study concludes that educating healthcare professionals about Muslim women’s worldview would enhance the quality of maternity care for Muslim women.",Raw data; Ethnic group; Nursing; Cultural competence; Perspective (graphical); Reproductive medicine; Religious values; Identity (social science); Islam; Medicine,Cultural competency; Islam; Maternity; Midwifery; Motherhood; Muslim women,Adult; Ethnicity/psychology; Female; Humans; Islam/psychology; Longitudinal Studies; Maternal Health Services; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women/psychology; Qualitative Research; United Kingdom,10.1186/s12884-019-2302-y,true

Giacomino; Peter Cram; Mary Vaughan-Sarrazin; Yunshu Zhou; Saket Girotra,"Although prices for medical services are known to vary markedly between hospitals, it remains unknown whether variation in hospital prices is explained by differences in hospital quality or reimbursement from major insurers. We obtained ""out-of-pocket"" price estimates for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) from a random sample of US hospitals for a hypothetical patient without medical insurance. We compared hospital CABG price to (1) ""fair price"" estimate from Healthcare Bluebook data using each hospital's zip code and (2) Society of Thoracic Surgeons composite CABG quality score and risk-adjusted mortality rate. Of 101 study hospitals, 53 (52.5%) were able to provide a complete price estimate for CABG. The mean price for CABG was $151,271 and ranged from $44,824 to $448,038. Except for geographic census region, which was weakly associated with price, hospital CABG price was not associated with other structural characteristics or CABG volume (p >0.10 for all). Likewise, there was no association between a hospital's price for CABG with average reimbursement from major insurers within the same zip code (ρ = 0.07, p value = 0.6), Society of Thoracic Surgeoncomposite quality score (ρ = 0.08, p value = 0.71), or risk-adjusted CABG mortality (ρ = -0.03 p value = 0.89). In conclusion, the price of CABG varied more than 10-fold across US hospitals. There was no correlation between price information obtained from hospitals and the average reimbursement from major insurers in the same market.

Few studies have collected breast cancer care data from mixed data sources and validated them, and to the best of our knowledge, none so far have been conducted in Israel, where National Health Insurance Law assures universal health care, delivered through four health care funds with computerized administrative, pharmaceutical and medical databases. This validation study is aimed to assess the accuracy and completeness of information on cancer care and health outcomes using several research tools, before embarking on a full-scale study aimed to evaluate the long-term treatment-related health adverse outcomes in a cohort of breast cancer survivors. One hundred twenty randomly sampled female patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer in years 2000–2010 in northern Israel, who are members of the “Leumit” healthcare fund, were included. Data sources included “Leumit” medical records, the National Cancer Registry and a self-report questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 99 % of the women contacted. The accuracy of the information regarding cancer care was assessed with the reference standard set as one of the research tools, varying per the characteristic being under investigation. For example: health outcomes and medical history were validated against “Leumit” medical records, while construct validity of the self-reported questionnaire served to assess the prevalence of chronic pain. Agreement, predictive values, correlations, and internal consistency were calculated. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess potential predictors of correct responses. The overall level of agreement (Kappa) was almost perfect for demographics and outcomes, above 0.8 for treatments and chronic pain, while only fair to moderate for most of the self-reported medical history. Correct responses of medical history were associated with Jewish ethnicity, recency of breast cancer diagnosis, and family history of cardiovascular disease. The internal consistency of the quality-of-life scale was above 0.9. In the absence of a national registry for cancer care, a mixed methodology for data collection is the most complete source.

Leading politicians and public servants took the overall decisions about the decommissioning programme, but the clinical decision-making and implementation was largely run by the clinic managers and their staff. As the decommissioning programme improved the finances, met relatively little resistance from the clinical departments, and neither patient safety nor quality of care were perceived to be negatively affected, the initial implementation could be considered successful. The aim of this study was to investigate clinic managers' experience of important factors enabling the successful implementation of a decommissioning programme in a local healthcare organization. Methods Drawing on a framework of factors and processes that shape successful implementation of decommissioning decisions, this study highlights the most important factors that enabled the clinic managers to successfully implement the decommissioning programme. During 2018, an interview study was conducted with 26 clinic managers, strategically selected to represent psychiatry, primary care, surgery and medicine. A deductive content analysis was used to analyze the interviews. By applying a framework to the data, the most important factors were illuminated. Results The findings highlighted factors and processes crucial to implementing the decommissioning programme: 1) create a story to get a shared image of the rationale for change, 2) secure an executive leadership team represented by clinical champions, 3) involve clinic managers at an early stage to ensure a fair decision-making process, 4) base the decommissioning decisions on evidence, without compromising quality and patient safety, 5) prepare the organisation to handle a process characterised by tensions and strong emotions, 6) communicate demonstrable benefits, 7) pay attention to the need of cultural and behavioral change and 8) transparently evaluate the outcome of the process. Conclusions From these findings, we conclude that in order to successfully implement a decommissioning programme, clinic managers and healthcare professions must be given and take responsibility, for both the process and outcome.",Health administration; Health informatics; Health care; Nuclear decommissioning; Patient safety; Balanced budget; Public relations; Restructuring; Nursing research; Medicine,Clinic manager; Decommissioning; Healthcare professionals; Implementation; Leadership; Local healthcare organisation,Administrative Personnel; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Budgets; Humans; Leadership; Primary Health Care,10.1186/s12913-021-06815-4,true

An analysis of progressivity in health systems financing,2017,journal article,International journal for equity in health,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,United Kingdom,Azaher Ali Molla; Chunhuei Chi,"The relationship between payments towards healthcare and ability to pay is a measure of financial fairness. Analysis of progressivity is important from an equity perspective as well as for macroeconomic and political analysis of healthcare systems. Bangladesh health systems financing is characterized by high out-of-pocket payments (63.3%), which is increasing. Hence, we aimed to see who pays what part of this high out-of-pocket expenditure. To our knowledge, this was the first progressivity analysis of health systems financing in Bangladesh. We used data from Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 2010. This was a cross sectional and nationally representative sample of 12,240 households consisting of 55,580 individuals. For quantification of progressivity, we adopted the ‘ability-to-pay’ principle developed by O’Donnell, van Doorslaer, Wagstaff, and Lindelow (2008). We used the Kakwani index to measure the magnitude of progressivity. Health systems financing in Bangladesh is regressive. Inequality increases due to healthcare payments. The differences between the Gini coefficient and the Kakwani index for all sources of finance are negative, which indicates regressivity, and that financing is more concentrated among the poor. Income inequality increases due to high out-of-pocket payments. The increase in income inequality caused by out-of-pocket payments is 89% due to negative vertical effect and 11% due to horizontal inequity. Our findings add substantial evidence of health systems financing impact on inequitable financial burden of healthcare and income. The heavy reliance on out-of-pocket payments may affect household living standards. If the government and people of Bangladesh are concerned about equitable financing burden, our study suggests that Bangladesh needs to reform the health systems financing scheme.",Public economics; Finance; Standard of living; Health care; Economics; Health equity; Gini coefficient; Household income; Health policy; Economic inequality; Equity (economics),Ability-to-pay; Health equity; Household healthcare expenditure; Out-of-pocket payments; Progressivity,Bangladesh; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care/economics; Family Characteristics; Health Equity; Health Expenditures/statistics & numerical data; Healthcare Financing; Humans; Income/statistics & numerical data; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires,10.1186/s12939-017-0654-3,true

Yardim; Tahsin Gökhan Telatar; Sarp Üner,"Introduction Turkey, which suffers from both undersupply of physicians, nurses and midwives and imbalanced distribution of healthcare personnel, has been developing and implementing various policies to solve these problems. The Ministry of Health launched the Health Transformation Program in 2003 for effective, efficient and fair provision of healthcare services for all people. This study aimed to take a closer look at the impact of policies implemented to reduce the imbalance of the distribution of human resources for health for the past 15 years in Turkey. Methods Data for the distributional imbalance obtained from Ministry of Health registries was analysed by using Lorenz curves and Gini coefficient for the years 2002, 2005, 2008, 2012 and 2016. Results Geographical imbalances for healthcare professions decreased distinguishably during the 15 years. Gini coefficient was 0.33 for specialist distribution in 2002, and decreased gradually to 0.26 in 2008 and finally 0.21 in 2016. Similarly, Gini coefficients were 0.18, 0.20 and 0.25 for general practitioners, nurses and midwives, respectively, in 2002. In 2012, Gini coefficients for the same professionals were calculated as 0.09, 0.11 and 0.19, respectively. Conclusion The findings indicate that the policies targeting the distribution of healthcare personnel in Turkey have yielded positive results. Yet it is evident that these results are not due to a single action.

The study’s aim was to compare how various healthcare professionals perceive success in BS. A 29-item, 10-point Likert scale online survey was distributed via email to Israeli healthcare professionals involved in the different BS aspects using common national professional organizations. These included bariatric surgeons, dietitians, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, primary care physicians, gastroenterologists, and nurses. Statement relevancy to BS success was rated. An item was classed as “very important” for BS success if at least 70% of participants rated it 8 or higher in each subgroup. Inter-observer agreement was calculated using kappa statistics. Data on specific occupation, years-in-practice, and major workplace were collected as well. A total of 155 responses was obtained.

Due to the significant role of ISSO in meeting the medical needs and its high coverage (almost 42%) in Iran, we aimed to identify the factors influencing medical facilities' fair distribution in the ISSO. Materials and Methods: This applied study was conducted as a descriptive study in the ISSO in 2018. Variables affecting medical facilities distribution were elicited from the literature review and through an interview with 16 experts who were occupied in the healthcare management field. Then, a Likert scale-based questionnaire with 56 items in 7 sections was developed. Questionnaires were distributed among 456 person received questionnaires, and 415 responded to all questions. All participants were experts in the healthcare section of the ISSO all over the country. Data were analyzed via exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and structural equations using SPSS 23 and AMOS-24 software. Results: By exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, seven main factors (demographic factors, geographical factors, functional factors, structural factors, humanistic factors, economic factors, and Contract parties factors) were identified as critical factors affecting medical facilities distribution. Each aspect included many components. AMOS software showed the significance of variables by P-value and critical ratio (CR) indices to analyze the conceptual model of the research. Function factors with standard coefficients of 0.85 had the most, and economic factors with a standard coefficient of 0.53 had a minor effect on the distribution of medical facilities in the ISSO. Conclusion: To have a more efficient medical facilities distribution in the ISSO must consider all identified factors, special attention should be given to the maximum use of available medical facilities. Furthermore, more attention should be paid to distributing human resources, finance, and medical equipment.</jats:p>",Likert scale; Confirmatory factor analysis; Structural equation modeling; Medicine; Exploratory factor analysis; Scale (ratio); Distribution (mathematics); Descriptive statistics; Minor (academic); Health care; Psychology; Clinical psychology; Statistics; Humanities; Psychometrics; Economic growth; Developmental psychology; Mathematical analysis; Physics; Philosophy; Mathematics; Quantum mechanics; Economics,,,10.31661/gmj.v11i.2012,true

Kush; Alexander Sherman; Eileen A. Navarro; Ronald D. Fitzmartin; Frank Pétavy; Jose Galvez; Lauren B. Becnel; F. L. Zhou; Nicole Harmon; Barbara Jauregui; Tammy Jackson; Lynn D. Hudson,"The value of robust and responsible data sharing in clinical research and healthcare is recognized by patients, patient advocacy groups, researchers, journal editors, and the healthcare industry globally. Privacy and security concerns acknowledged, the act of exchanging data (interoperability) along with its meaning (semantic interoperability) across studies and between partners has been difficult, if not elusive. For shared data to retain its value, a recommendation has been made to follow the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) principles. Without applying appropriate data exchange standards with domain-relevant content standards and accessible rich metadata that uses applicable terminologies, interoperability is burdened by the need for transformation and/or mapping. These obstacles to interoperability limit the findability, accessibility and reusability of data, thus diminishing its value and making it impossible to adhere to FAIR principles. One effort to standardize data collection has been through common data elements (CDEs). CDEs are data collection units comprising one or more questions together with a set of valid values. Some CDEs contain standardized terminology concepts that define the meaning of the data, and others include links to unique terminology concept identifiers and unique identifiers for each CDE; however, usually CDEs are defined for specific projects or collaborations and lack traceable or machine readable semantics. While the name implies that these are 'common', this has not necessarily been a requirement, and many CDEs have not been commonly used. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) CDEs are, in fact, a conglomerate of CDEs developed in silos by various NIH institutes. Therefore, CDEs have not brought the anticipated benefit to the industry through widescale interoperability, nor is there widespread reuse of CDEs. Certain institutes in the NIH recommend, albeit do not enforce, institute-specific preferred CDEs; however, at the NIH level a preponderance of choice and a lack of any overarching harmonization of CDEs or consistency in linking them to controlled terminology or common identifiers create confusion for researchers in their efforts to identify the best CDEs for their protocol. The problem of comparing data among studies is exacerbated when researchers select different CDEs for the same variable or data collection field. This manuscript explores reasons for the disappointingly low adoption of CDEs and the inability of CDEs or other clinical research standards to broadly solve the interoperability and data sharing problems. Recommendations are offered for rectifying this situation to enable responsible data sharing that will help in adherence to FAIR principles and the realization of Learning Health Systems for the sake of all of us as patients.",Unique identifier; Data exchange; Learning standards; Findability; Semantic interoperability; Interoperability; Data science; Data sharing; Computer science; Metadata,,Biomedical Research; Common Data Elements; Humans; Information Dissemination; Metadata; Population Health,10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103421,true

Pronovost; Imogen Mitchell; Christian Dankers; David W.

We aimed to examine the role of formal channels in encouraging or inhibiting employee voice about concerns. Methods Qualitative study involving personnel from three academic hospitals in two countries. Interviews were conducted with 165 participants from a wide range of occupational and professional backgrounds, including senior leaders and those from the sharp end of care. Data analysis was based on the constant comparative method. Results Leaders reported that they valued employee voice; they identified formal organisational channels as a key route for the expression of concerns by employees. Formal channels and processes were designed to ensure fairness, account for all available evidence and achieve appropriate resolution. When processed through these formal systems, concerns were destined to become evidenced, formal and tractable to organisational intervention. But the way these systems operated meant that some concerns were never voiced. Participants were anxious about having to process their suspicions and concerns into hard evidentiary facts, and they feared being drawn into official procedures designed to allocate consequence. Anxiety about evidence and process was particularly relevant when the intelligence was especially ‘soft’—feelings or intuitions that were difficult to resolve into a coherent, compelling reconstruction of an incident or concern. Efforts to make soft intelligence hard thus risked creating ‘forbidden knowledge’: dangerous to know or share. Conclusions The legal and bureaucratic considerations that govern formal channels for the voicing of concerns may, perversely, inhibit staff from speaking up.

Recommendations to Improve Survival.,2020,journal article,Critical care medicine,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),United States,Charles L. Sprung; Gavin M. Joynt; Michael D. Christian; Robert D. Truog; Jordi Rello; Joseph L. Nates,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 patients are currently overwhelming the world's healthcare systems. This article provides practical guidance to front-line physicians forced to make critical rationing decisions. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Medline search for scientific literature, reviews, and guidance documents related to epidemic ICU triage including from professional bodies. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical studies, reviews, and guidelines were selected and reviewed by all authors and discussed by internet conference and email. DATA EXTRACTION: References and data were based on relevance and author consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: We review key challenges of resource-driven triage and data from affected ICUs. We recommend that once available resources are maximally extended, triage is justified utilizing a strategy that provides the greatest good for the greatest number of patients. A triage algorithm based on clinical estimations of the incremental survival benefit (saving the most life-years) provided by ICU care is proposed. ""First come, first served"" is used to choose between individuals with equal priorities and benefits. The algorithm provides practical guidance, is easy to follow, rapidly implementable and flexible. It has four prioritization categories: performance score, ASA score, number of organ failures, and predicted survival. Individual units can readily adapt the algorithm to meet local requirements for the evolving pandemic. Although the algorithm improves consistency and provides practical and psychologic support to those performing triage, the final decision remains a clinical one. Depending on country and operational circumstances, triage decisions may be made by a triage team or individual doctors. However, an experienced critical care specialist physician should be ultimately responsible for the triage decision. Cautious discharge criteria are proposed acknowledging the difficulties to facilitate the admission of queuing patients. CONCLUSIONS: Individual institutions may use this guidance to develop prospective protocols that assist the implementation of triage decisions to ensure fairness, enhance consistency, and decrease provider moral distress.",Relevance (law); Rationing; Intensive care unit; Triage; Data extraction; MEDLINE; Scientific literature; Specialist Physician; Medical emergency; Medicine,,"Adult; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Critical Care/standards; Health Care Rationing/methods; Humans; Intensive Care Units/organization & administration; Pandemics; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics & numerical data; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Practice Guidelines as Topic; SARS-CoV-2; Triage/methods",10.1097/ccm.0000000000004410,true

Johnson; Chunhui Gu; Zhengjia Chen; Chad Robichaux; Nicole L Metzger,"PURPOSE We evaluated a previously published risk model (Novant model) to identify patients at risk for healthcare facility-onset Clostridioides difficile infection (HCFO-CDI) at 2 hospitals within a large health system and compared its predictive value to that of a new model developed based on local findings. METHODS We conducted a retrospective case-control study including adult patients admitted from July 1, 2016, to July 1, 2018. Patients with HCFO-CDI who received systemic antibiotics were included as cases and were matched 1 to 1 with controls (who received systemic antibiotics without developing HCFO-CDI). We extracted chart data on patient risk factors for CDI, including those identified in prior studies and those included in the Novant model. We applied the Novant model to our patient population to assess the model's utility and generated a local model using logistic regression-based prediction scores. A receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) score was determined for each model. RESULTS We included 362 patients, with 161 controls and 161 cases. The Novant model had a ROC-AUC of 0.62 in our population. Our local model using risk factors identifiable at hospital admission included hospitalization within 90 days of admission (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.06-6.04), hematologic malignancy (adjusted OR, 12.87; 95% CI, 3.70-44.80), and solid tumor malignancy (adjusted OR, 4.76; 95% CI, 1.27-17.80) as HCFO-CDI predictors and had a ROC-AUC score of 0.74. CONCLUSION The Novant model evaluating risk factors identifiable at admission poorly predicted HCFO-CDI in our population, while our local model was a fair predictor. These findings highlight the need for institutions to review local risk factors to adjust modeling for their patient population.",Risk assessment; Internal medicine; Logistic regression; Odds ratio; Malignancy; Population; Confidence interval; Receiver operating characteristic; Medicine; Area under the curve,"Clostridioides difficile

Myles,"Accurately measuring the incidence of major postoperative complications is essential for funding and reimbursement of healthcare providers, for internal and external benchmarking of hospital performance and for valid and reliable public reporting of outcomes. Actual or surrogate outcomes data are typically obtained by one of three methods: clinical quality registries, clinical audit, or administrative data. In 2017 a perioperative registry was developed at the Alfred Hospital and mapped to administrative and clinical data. This study investigated the statistical agreement between administrative data (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (10th edition) Australian Modification codes) and clinical audit by anaesthetists in identifying major postoperative complications. The study population included 482 high-risk surgical patients referred to the Alfred Hospital anaesthesia postoperative service over two years. Clinical audit was conducted to determine the presence of major complications and these data were compared to administrative data. The main outcome was statistical agreement between the two methods, as defined by Cohen's kappa statistic. Substantial agreement was observed for five major complications, moderate agreement for three, fair agreement for six and poor agreement for two. Sensitivity and positive predictive value ranged from 0 to 100%. Specificity was above 90% for all complications. There was important variation in inter-rater agreement. For four of the five complications with substantial agreement between administrative data and clinical audit, sensitivity was only moderate (61.5%-75%). Using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (10th edition) Australian Modification codes to identify postoperative complications at our hospital has high specificity but is likely to underestimate the incidence compared to clinical audit. Further, retrospective clinical audit itself is not a highly reliable method of identifying complications. We believe a perioperative clinical quality registry is necessary to validly and reliably measure major postoperative complications in Australia for benchmarking of hospital performance and before public reporting of outcomes should be considered.",Cohen's kappa; Emergency medicine; Clinical audit; International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems; Reimbursement; ICD-10; Perioperative; Incidence (epidemiology); Medicine; Benchmarking,ICD-10; Postoperative complications; administrative data; anaesthesia; complications < anaesthesia; high-risk patients; perioperative anaesthesia < anaesthesia; quality assurance < anaesthesia; surgery,Australia/epidemiology; Data Collection; Humans; Postoperative Complications/diagnosis; Registries; Retrospective Studies,10.1177/0310057x20905606,true

So; Bernard M. H. Law; Dorothy N.S. Chan; Weijie Xing; Carmen W.H. Chan; Alexandra L. McCarthy,"Background Cancer patients often experience multiple concurrent and related symptoms, or symptom clusters. Research increasingly indicates that targeting a symptom cluster as an overall entity instead of individual symptoms could be more effective and efficient in improving patients' quality of life. Various nonpharmacological interventions are used to manage symptom clusters in cancer patients during and after treatment, but the effect of such interventions is uncertain. Objective To provide a summary of such interventions and evaluate their effects in terms of symptom cluster severity, quality of life, and functional ability of patients with cancer. Methods A comprehensive literature search of 5 English and 2 Chinese electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, CNKI, and Wanfang) was combined with hand searching, to identify eligible research studies from 2001 to January 2018. Two reviewers carried out data selection, data extraction, and quality appraisal independently. A narrative approach was used to summarize data. Results Thirteen randomized controlled trials, involving 1490 patients, were included in the review. The methodological quality of the studies was generally fair. Nonpharmacological interventions can reduce the severity of symptom clusters, especially the pain-fatigue-sleep disturbance, cognitive, and gastrointestinal clusters, and improve both quality of life and functional ability. Conclusions While symptom cluster interventions are potentially useful in cancer care, further well-designed research is needed to test them rigorously on various types of cancer symptom clusters. Implications for Practice Nonpharmacological interventions are shown to be effective in managing cancer-associated symptom clusters and could be considered as part of the existing healthcare services for cancer patients.",Randomized controlled trial; Intensive care medicine; Psychological intervention; Data extraction; MEDLINE; PsycINFO; Quality of life (healthcare); CINAHL; Functional ability; Medicine,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Behavior Therapy/methods; Fatigue/etiology; Female; Humans; Male; Neoplasms/complications; Pain/etiology; Pain Management/methods; Sleep Wake Disorders/etiology; Syndrome",10.1097/ncc.0000000000000730,false

However, all the available methods for exposure assessment have been developed, tested and used in high-income countries. Except for a few studies examining pesticide exposures, there is limited research on whether these methods are appropriate for assessing exposure in LMICs. The aim of this study is to compare a task-specific algorithm-based method (OccIDEAS) to a job-specific matrix method (OAsJEM) in the assessment of asthmagen exposures among healthcare workers in a high-income country and a low- and middle- income country (LMIC) to determine an appropriate assessment method for use in LMICs for future research.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Data were obtained from a national cross-sectional survey of occupational asthmagens exposure in Australia and a cross-sectional survey of occupational chemical exposure among Bhutanese healthcare workers.

The agreement as indicated by κ (Cohen's Kappa coefficient) for six of the seven agents assessed was poor to fair (0.02 to 0.37). In Bhutan, the prevalence of exposure assessed by OccIDEAS was higher for four of the seven agents and κ was poor for all the four agents assessed (-0.06 to 0.13). The OAsJEM overestimated exposures to high-level disinfectants by assigning exposures to all participants from 10 (Bhutan) and 12 (Australia) ISCO-88 codes; whereas OccIDEAS assigned exposures to varying proportions of participants from these ISCO-codes.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">There was poor to fair agreement in the assessment of asthmagen exposure in healthcare workers between the two methods. The OAsJEM overestimated the prevalence of certain exposures. As compared to the OAsJEM, OccIDEAS appeared to be more appropriate for evaluating cross-country exposures to asthmagens in healthcare workers due to its inherent quality of assessing task-based determinants and its versatility in being adaptable for use in different countries with different exposure circumstances.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2022.

Objective This umbrella review aimed to synthesise the combined evidence from systematic reviews assessing the impact of person-centred care interventions on patient safety. Design A three-step review process included a preliminary review of literature, a comprehensive search, and manual searching of reference lists and forward citations of selected reviews. The review protocol was registered with Prospero (CRD42018090048). Data sources Reviewers searched 10 databases for systematic reviews published in English-language peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and 2019: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, JBI Database, Medline, ProQuest Health & Medicine, PROSPERO Register, PubMed and Scopus. Review methods Covidence software was used to manage screening and eligibility. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, reviewed full texts of articles for eligibility, and appraised the quality of reviews using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses. Results From an initial total of 3412 potential titles, 16 reviews met the inclusion criteria. The selected reviews examined the impact of person-centred care for diverse groups of patients (children, adults and older people) in varied settings. Most systematic reviews assessed experimental studies, generally comparing person-centred interventions with ‘usual care’, often demonstrating limited evidence of impact on safety. Reviews addressed several patient safety outcomes relevant to nursing, including falls, infections, medication use and misuse, and mortality rates. The systematic reviews were generally well conducted, although several included studies of poor or fair quality. Given the heterogeneity of the interventions, outcomes and research designs of studies included in the selected reviews, we were unable to draw unequivocal conclusions about the implications of person-centred care for patient safety in this umbrella review. However, there was some encouraging evidence that person-centred care initiatives may result in reduced rates of falls (in acute care and residential aged care settings). The review also highlighted reductions in agitation for people with dementia and some improvement in anti-psychotic medication use in older people with dementia. Conclusions Although abundant evidence exists demonstrating the positive effects of person-centred care on healthcare quality and on patient (and provider) wellbeing, there is little research focussing specifically on the impact of person-centred care on patient safety. Thus, there is scope for further high-quality nursing research into how person-centred interventions improve specific patient safety outcomes in order to inform more widespread adoption of person-centred practice.",Critical appraisal; Health care; Systematic review; Cochrane Library; Nursing literature; Patient safety; Acute care; Family medicine; Nursing research; Medicine,Medical errors; Medication errors; Nurse-patient relations; Patient harm; Patient safety; Patient-centred care; Person-centred care; Systematic reviews,Adult; Aged; Child; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Nursing Research; Patient Safety; Patient-Centered Care; Systematic Reviews as Topic,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103658,true

Since these WBAN users have individual decision-making capabilities and are self-centric in nature, they always aim to maximize their own performance while expecting benefits through resource sharing. In this article, we analyze the interaction among participating WBANs in BBN and develop joint data uploading and relaying strategy. In BBN, each WBAN not only utilizes its resources (uplink capacity and battery energy) to upload physiological data but also trades resources with other participating WBANs. Specifically, WBAN users with unused resources trade with other users deprived of Internet connection and low battery for mutual gain. Therefore, we model this interaction as an <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$N $ </tex-math></inline-formula> -person bargaining game and design an efficient incentive mechanism to facilitate user cooperation. The proposed mechanism ensures efficient resource sharing and fair division of mutual benefit among the participating WBAN users. Also, we propose a distributed algorithm for the practical implementation of the proposed mechanism in decentralized BBN.

Digital health applications in healthcare include telemedicine, electronic health records, wearable, implantable, injectable and ingestible digital medical devices, health mobile apps as well as the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to medical and public health prognosis and decision-making. As is often the case with technological advancement, progress in digital health raises compelling ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI). This article aims to succinctly map relevant ELSI of the digital health field. The issues of patient autonomy; assessment, value attribution, and validation of health innovation; equity and trustworthiness in healthcare; professional roles and skills and data protection and security are highlighted against the backdrop of the risks of dehumanization of care, the limitations of machine learning-based decision-making and, ultimately, the future contours of human interaction in medicine and public health. The running theme to this article is the underlying tension between the promises of digital health and its many challenges, which is heightened by the contrasting pace of scientific progress and the timed responses provided by law and ethics. Digital applications can prove to be valuable allies for human skills in medicine and public health.

I. Zimmermann; Marina Cuttini; Jennifer Zeitlin,"Follow-up of very preterm infants is essential for reducing risks of health and developmental problems and relies on parental engagement. We investigated parents’ perceptions of post-discharge healthcare for their children born very preterm in a European multi-country cohort study. Data come from a 5-year follow-up of an area-based cohort of births <32 weeks’ gestation in 19 regions from 11 European countries. Perinatal data were collected from medical records and 5-year data from parent-report questionnaires. Parents rated post-discharge care related to their children’s preterm birth (poor/fair/good/excellent) and provided free-text suggestions for improvements. We analyzed sociodemographic and medical factors associated with poor/fair ratings, using inverse probability weights to adjust for attrition bias, and assessed free-text responses using thematic analysis. Questionnaires were returned for 3635 children (53.8% response rate). Care was rated as poor/fair for 14.2% [from 6.1% (France) to 31.6% (Denmark)]; rates were higher when children had health or developmental problems (e.g. cerebral palsy (34.4%) or epilepsy (36.9%)). From 971 responses, 4 themes and 25 subthemes concerning care improvement were identified.

Aims This study aimed to assess evidence-based medicine (EBM) knowledge, practices and attitudes among physicians in Tanta University hospital, Tanta, Egypt. Methods A cross-sectional study was used. Collection of data was by a self-administrated questionnaire distributed to 398 physicians in different specialties during 2017. Results Response rate was 93.6 %. More than half (61.3 %) of participants reported Pub Med as used in decision-making. Physicians with good knowledge of EBM represented 10.5 %, those with fair knowledge represented 54 %, and those with poor knowledge represented 35.5 %. Regarding attitudes towards EBM, 76.4 % of study participants welcomed the current promotion of EBM; 81.4 % thought that it useful to use research findings in daily management of patients; and 89.9 % thought that practicing EBM improved patient outcomes. More than half of participants (55.8 %) had attended courses related to EBM, but only 6.8 % had attended courses related to critical appraisal. The majority of participants (97 %) had access to the World Wide Web. Barriers reported by participants that interfere with EBM practice were patient overload (68.1 %), lack of time (60.1 %), colleagues' attitudes (47 %), lack of skills (46.7 %), and fear of criticism (44.5 %). Conclusions Most participants in this study have a positive attitude towards EBM, have a fair knowledge of it, but poor practices.

While there has been significant work on analysing and mitigating algorithmic bias, the broader mechanisms of how bias emerges in AI applications are not well understood, hampering efforts to address bias where it begins. In this article, we illustrate how bias in AI-assisted decision-making can arise from a range of specific design decisions, each of which may seem self-contained and non-biasing when considered separately. These design decisions include basic problem formulation, the data chosen for analysis, the use the AI technology is put to, and operational design elements in addition to the core algorithmic design. We draw on three historical models of disability common to different decision-making settings to demonstrate how differences in the definition of disability can lead to highly distinct decisions on each of these aspects of design, leading in turn to AI technologies with a variety of biases and downstream effects. We further show that the potential harms arising from inappropriate definitions of disability in fundamental design stages are further amplified by a lack of transparency and disabled participation throughout the AI design process. Our analysis provides a framework for critically examining AI technologies in decision-making contexts and guiding the development of a design praxis for disability-related AI analytics. We put forth this article to provide key questions to facilitate disability-led design and participatory development to produce more fair and equitable AI technologies in disability-related contexts.</jats:p>",Computer science; Transparency (behavior); Data science; Implementation; Software deployment; Risk analysis (engineering); Variety (cybernetics); Management science; Artificial intelligence; Computer security; Business; Engineering; Software engineering,,,10.5210/fm.v28i1.12903,false

Sharing healthcare data is time-consuming and notoriously difficult due to privacy and regulatory concerns. The Personal Health Train (PHT) provides a privacy-by-design infrastructure connecting FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data sources and allows distributed data analysis and machine learning. Patient data never leaves a healthcare institute. Materials and methods Lung cancer patient-specific databases (tumor staging and post-treatment survival information) of oncology departments were translated according to a FAIR data model and stored locally in a graph database. Software was installed locally to enable deployment of distributed machine learning algorithms via a central server. Algorithms (MATLAB, code and documentation publicly available) are patient privacy-preserving as only summary statistics and regression coefficients are exchanged with the central server. A logistic regression model to predict post-treatment two-year survival was trained and evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), root mean square prediction error (RMSE) and calibration plots. Results In 4 months, we connected databases with 23 203 patient cases across 8 healthcare institutes in 5 countries (Amsterdam, Cardiff, Maastricht, Manchester, Nijmegen, Rome, Rotterdam, Shanghai) using the PHT. Summary statistics were computed across databases. A distributed logistic regression model predicting post-treatment two-year survival was trained on 14 810 patients treated between 1978 and 2011 and validated on 8 393 patients treated between 2012 and 2015. Conclusion The PHT infrastructure demonstrably overcomes patient privacy barriers to healthcare data sharing and enables fast data analyses across multiple institutes from different countries with different regulatory regimens. This infrastructure promotes global evidence-based medicine while prioritizing patient privacy.",Software deployment; Logistic regression; Health care; Graph database; Interoperability; Data science; Computer science; Documentation; Big data; Data model,Big data; Distributed learning; FAIR data; Federated learning; Lung cancer; Machine learning; Prediction modeling; Survival analysis,Algorithms; China; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Machine Learning; Privacy,10.1016/j.radonc.2019.11.019,true

Cappelleri; Ho Yin Ng; David Witcombe,"The objective of this report was to evaluate perceptions of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) treatment and satisfaction with healthcare professional (HCP) communication among patients with PsA in Australia, compared with overall global perceptions. Data were collected via a global and country-specific survey (The Harris Poll; November 2, 2017–March 12, 2018). Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years old, had been diagnosed with PsA > 1 year prior, had seen a rheumatologist or dermatologist within the past 12 months, and had previously received ≥ 1 conventional synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. Data reported by patients included baseline demographics, overall health, time since PsA diagnosis, PsA severity, satisfaction with current PsA medication and management, and experiences regarding communication with their HCP. Descriptive statistics were obtained. Most patients in Australia were very or somewhat satisfied with their PsA medication, and reported always or often taking their medication exactly as directed by their HCP. However, the majority still experienced symptoms, reported their overall health as poor or fair, and would change something about their PsA medication. While the majority of patients in Australia were satisfied with the communication with their HCP, most would prefer increased communication but some felt that asking too many questions would affect the quality of their care. Perceptions in Australia were similar to global perceptions. Although most patients with PsA in Australia were satisfied with their disease management and communication with their HCP, many still experienced symptoms, would change something about their PsA medication, and would prefer increased communication with their HCP. Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) can cause tender and swollen joints. If not treated properly, the joint damage can get worse, until patients struggle to cope with everyday tasks. Patients and their doctors need to communicate well to successfully manage PsA. We used an online survey to ask patients in Australia how they feel about their PsA medication and the way they communicate with their doctor. These patients were adults who had had PsA for more than 1 year, had seen a specialist doctor in the past year, and had taken one or more prescription PsA medications. A total of 152 patients in Australia completed the survey. Most patients were very or somewhat satisfied with the PsA medication they were taking, and most always or often took it exactly as their doctor told them to. However, almost all patients still had symptoms, most said their overall health was poor or fair, and most would like to change something about their medication. While most patients were satisfied with the communication with their doctor about PsA, most wished they talked more with their doctor about their PsA and treatment goals, but some felt that asking too many questions would harm their quality of care. Patients in Australia had similar answers to patients who answered the survey in other countries. Although the survey was limited by the number of patients who responded, and whether patients answered questions properly, it suggests that patients and doctors need to communicate more closely to improve PsA management.",Medical prescription; Disease management (health); Psoriatic arthritis; Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug; Patient survey; Patient perceptions; Affect (psychology); Descriptive statistics; Family medicine; Medicine,Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug; Physician–patient relations; Psoriatic arthritis; Rheumatic diseases,,10.1007/s40744-021-00297-w,true

It promises benefits for population health but might also lead to health inequities. From an ethical perspective, it is hence much needed to adopt a fair approach. This article aims at outlining chances and challenges from an ethical perspective, focusing especially on the dimension of justice-a value, which has been described as the core value for public health. Analysed through the lenses of a standard approach for health justice-Norman Daniels' account of just health and accountability for reasonableness-most recent and relevant literature was reviewed and challenges from a justice point of view were identified. Among them are challenges with regard to digital illiteracy, resulting inequities in access to healthcare, truthful information sharing to end users demanding fully informed consent, dignity and fairness in storage, access, sharing and ownership of data. All stakeholders involved bear responsibilities to shape digital health in an ethical and fair way.

The digitalisation of the welfare state creates new opportunities for proactively contacting people who are potentially entitled to benefits, but do not take up their social rights. In this study, we report on how new data flows were used to reach out to potential beneficiaries of the Increased Reimbursement of health care, a programme targeted at low-income households in Belgium. By randomizing the period in which potential beneficiaries were contacted, we were able to identify a three- to four-fold increase in take-up among those contacted as a result of the outreaching activities. Households that did not respond to the intervention, the never takers, have lower pre-intervention healthcare expenditures. This suggests that non-take-up was reduced primarily among those who would expect to benefit most from receiving the Increased Reimbursement. Exploiting the combination of rich administrative data with experimental evidence, we also find that early responders are mostly older and have higher historic health expenditures than late responders. Furthermore, results point to the need for balancing well the inclusiveness of the intervention with an increased number of applications by ineligible people.</jats:p>",Reimbursement; Intervention (counseling); Scale (ratio); Welfare; Health care; Public economics; Business; Demographic economics; Social Welfare; Economic growth; Medicine; Economics; Political science; Nursing; Geography; Market economy; Cartography; Law,,,10.1017/s004727942100088x,true

Pimentel,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in drastic changes in hospitals’ practices and their case mix. This has a direct impact on the framework used for reporting and risk-adjusting healthcare-associated infections (HAI), such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) and central line-associated bloodstream infections. Metrics related to HAIs are incorporated into public and private ranking programmes for hospitals, including the Hospital Compare programme by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade, and Vizient’s Quality and Accountability Study. While the importance of preventing these infections is widely recognised, appropriately risk-adjusting HAI rates continue to be a challenge and source of debate.1 2 We believe that the changes wrought in hospitals by the COVID-19 pandemic provide a fresh opportunity to rethink our frameworks for measuring and benchmarking HAIs.; ; Measuring the unadjusted incidence of HAIs is not equitable, as the risk of infection varies widely between hospitals depending on the patients they serve and the services they offer—healthcare facilities that care for older or more complex patients are likely to have higher rates of HAIs compared with facilities that serve younger patients with less complex disorders, even if they implement the same rigorous infection control measures. To help make fair comparisons, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) calculates a standardised infection rate (SIR) for each facility based on the presumed characteristics of their patients and the type of services being provided. To this end, hospitals submit their observed HAI cases, as well as data on the population at risk (ie, the denominator) for risk adjustment, via the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). An elaborate framework is used for risk adjustment of each HAI. For example, CAUTI risk adjustment is based on the number of catheter-days in each type of hospital unit (medical intensive care, medical/surgical …",Health care; Infection control; Risk of infection; Medicaid; Hospital medicine; Population; Intensive care; Medical emergency; Medicine; Case mix index,health policy; healthcare quality improvement; hospital medicine; infection control; quality measurement,COVID-19/epidemiology; Humans; Risk Adjustment; SARS-CoV-2,10.1136/bmjqs-2020-012074,true

This study aims to assess (trends in) socioeconomic inequalities in site-specific cancer mortality in Belgian women. Data were derived from record linkage between the Belgian census and register data on mortality for 1991–1997 and 2001–2008 for all Belgian female inhabitants aged 50–79 years. Both absolute and relative inequalities by education and housing conditions were calculated. The results revealed persisting socioeconomic inequalities in total and site-specific cancer mortality. As expected, these inequalities were larger for the more preventable cancer sites. Generally, socioeconomic inequalities remained quite stable between the 1990s and the 2000s, although for some preventable cancer sites (e.g., uterus and oesophagus) a significant increase in inequality was observed. These persisting socioeconomic inequalities are likely due to differences in exposure to risk factors and unhealthy behaviours, and access and utilization of healthcare across the social strata. Since equality in health should be a priority for a fair public health policy, efforts to reduce inequalities in risk behaviours and access and use of health care should remain high on the agenda.",Epidemiology; Public health; Record linkage; Socioeconomic status; Demography; Health care; Health equity; Inequality; Social stratification; Medicine,Belgium; Cancer; Inequalities; Mortality; Socioeconomic; Trends,Aged; Belgium/epidemiology; Female; Health Behavior; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms/mortality; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors,10.1007/s10552-017-0921-z,false

This study explored the experiences of people aged 65+ in Irish EDs, involving secondary analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from the 2019 National Inpatient Experience Survey (NIES). Experiences in the ED and overall hospital experiences were dichotomized as poor to fair or good to very good. Logistic regression was used to model quantitative data. Free text comments relating to EDs were thematically analyzed. Of 12,343 survey participants, 4,442 (39.9%) were aged 65+ years and used the ED. Longer waiting times, completion of the questionnaire by another person either with or on behalf of the patient, and having both a medical card and private health insurance were predictors of poor to fair ED experiences. Patients aged 85+ years were more likely to report good to very good ED experiences. Poor experiences in the ED were associated with poorer overall hospital experiences (odds ratio [OR]: 2.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.76 to 2.73, <i>p</i> < .001). Thematic analysis revealed that long waiting times and unpleasant waiting conditions, including lack of communication, privacy, and personal care were important challenges encountered in the ED, with some older patients noting their preference for separate ED services. There is a need to reduce waiting times and integrate user perspectives in the planning, organization, and delivery of ED care to improve experiences and quality of care for a growing older population.",Emergency department; Thematic analysis; Medicine; Population; Health care; Family medicine; Psychology; Gerontology; Nursing; Qualitative research; Sociology; Environmental health; Social science; Economics; Economic growth,care experience; emergency care; emergency department; mixed methods; older people; patient experience,,10.1177/23743735211065267,true

But nothing is known about the implementation status of OTP. Thus, this evaluation aims to evaluate the implementation status of OTP in Dehana district, northern Ethiopia.  METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional evaluation with concurrent mixed-method was employed from 1st February to 30th April 2020. A total of 39 indicators were used to evaluate the availability, compliance and acceptability dimensions of the program implementation. A total of 422 mothers/caregivers for exit interview, 384 children's (diagnosed with acute malnutrition) record reviews, nine key informants' interview, and 63 observations were done in this evaluation. A multi-variable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the predictor variables associated with acceptability. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and p-value &lt; 0.05 were used to declare statistically significant variables. The qualitative data were tape recorded, transcribed in Amharic and translated into English and finally thematic analysis was done.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The overall implementation of OTP was 78% measured by availability (87.5%), compliance (75.3%), and acceptability (71.0%) dimensions. Trained healthcare providers, Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF), Mebendazole, and Oral Rehydration Salt (ORS) were available in all health posts, whereas vitamin A and folic acid were stocked out in some health posts. The health care providers complained that interruption of supplies, work overload and improper usage of RUTF by caregivers were the common challenges of program delivery. Rural residence (AOR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.09-0.39), knowledge on childhood malnutrition and program services (AOR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.04-4.97), and had malnourished children previously (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.01-3.30) were significantly associated with the acceptability of OTP program.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The overall implementation status of OTP was judged fair. Low achievement was observed on the compliance of health care providers to the standards, and acceptability of program services. Therefore, the program needs great improvement to enhance the outcome of childhood malnutrition management.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2022.

In this work, we leveraged large-scale, real-world data, i.e., statewide surveillance records and publicly available data resources encoding social determinants of health (SDoH), to identify social and racial disparities contributing to individuals' risk of HIV infection. We used the Florida Department of Health's Syndromic Tracking and Reporting System (STARS) database (including 100,000+ individuals screened for HIV infection and their partners), and a novel algorithmic fairness assessment method -the Fairness-Aware Causal paThs decompoSition (FACTS)- merging causal inference and artificial intelligence. FACTS deconstructs disparities based on SDoH and individuals' characteristics, and can discover novel mechanisms of inequity, quantifying to what extent they could be reduced by interventions. We paired the deidentified demographic information (age, gender, drug use) of 44,350 individuals in STARS -with non-missing data on interview year, county of residence, and infection status- to eight SDoH, including access to healthcare facilities, % uninsured, median household income, and violent crime rate. Using an expert-reviewed causal graph, we found that the risk of HIV infection for African Americans was higher than for non- African Americans (both in terms of direct and total effect), although a null effect could not be ruled out. FACTS identified several paths leading to racial disparity in HIV risk, including multiple SDoH: education, income, violent crime, drinking, smoking, and rurality.",,artificial intelligence; causal inference; disparity; epidemiology; human immunodeficiency virus; machine learning; real-world data; social determinants of health; surveillance,,10.1109/bibm55620.2022.9995662,true

Tamil Nadu (TN) and Rajasthan have implemented free medicine scheme in all public hospitals and West Bengal (WB) has devised Fair Price Medicine Shop (FPMS) scheme, a public-private-partnership model in the state. In this background, the objectives of the paper are to -;  National Sample Survey (71st and 60th round) data, Detailed Demand for Grants of the state governments and the National Rural/Urban Health Mission data have been used for the study. Exploratory data analysis and benefit incidence analysis have been applied to estimate the utilization, OOPE and extend of equity in the states. The results show that overall utilization of public facilities in TN and Rajasthan has increased substantially; whereas, utilization of public facility has decreased in WB even among the poorest. In addition, OOPE for both medical and medicine is the highest in WB among three states for public sector hospitalizations. Surprisingly, OOPE on medicine is the highest for the poorest class of WB. Analysis showed that the mismatch between actual need and FPMS drug-list has led to high OOPE in the state. Overall, benefit incidence of public subsidy is the highest among the poorest class in all the states. However, geographical sector-wise inequity in public subsidy distribution persists in the states. Analysis of cost of inpatient care shows that TN provides the maximum subsidy for hospitalization and WB provides the minimum. An inverse relationship between utilization of inpatient care and public subsidy has been observed from the analysis. In conclusion we could say that TN & Rajasthan have successfully implemented their health financing strategies to reduce the health expenditure burden.

Focus was on predisposing characteristics (age, gender, marital status, education and region), oral health needs (problems with teeth or gums and self-rated oral health) and enabling factors (dental health insurance, length of stay in the United States, acculturation and family network). Methods Using data from surveys with Korean Americans aged 60 or older (N = 2128), a Poisson regression model examined predictors of dental visit in the past 12 months. Findings More than 21% of the sample reported having a problem with teeth or gums, and over half rated their oral health as either fair or poor. Approximately 71% lacked dental health insurance. The number of dental visits in the past 12 months averaged 1.40 (SD = 1.74), with about 38% having no dental visits at all. Multivariate analyses showed that higher levels of education, the presence of a problem with teeth or gums, dental health insurance coverage, longer length of stay in the United States, and larger family networks were associated with 1.01-1.35 times higher number of dental visits.

To be trustfully adopted, AI needs to be lawful, ethical and robust. This article covers the different aspects of a safe and sustainable deployment of AI in radiology during: training, integration and regulation. For training, data must be appropriately valued, and deals with AI companies must be centralized. Companies must clearly define anonymization and consent, and patients must be well-informed about their data usage. Data fed into algorithms must be made AI-ready by refining, purification, digitization and centralization. Finally, data must represent various demographics. AI needs to be safely integrated with radiologists-in-the-loop: guiding forming concepts of AI solutions and supervising training and feedback. To be well-regulated, AI systems must be approved by a health authority and agreements must be made upon liability for errors, roles of supervised and unsupervised AI and fair workforce distribution (between AI and radiologists), with a renewal of policy at regular intervals. Any errors made must have a root-cause analysis, with outcomes fedback to companies to close the loop-thus enabling a dynamic best prediction system. In the distant future, AI may act autonomously with little human supervision. Ethical training and integration can ensure a ""transparent"" technology that will allow insight: helping us reflect on our current understanding of imaging interpretation and fill knowledge gaps, eventually moulding radiological practice.

Warren; Julie Ritter; Pooja Sripad; Timothy Abuya,"Promoting respect and dignity is a key component of providing quality care during facility-based childbirth and is becoming a critical indicator of maternal health care. Providing quality care requires essential skills and attitudes from healthcare providers, as their role is central to optimizing interventions in maternity settings. In 13 facilities in Kenya we conducted a mixed methods, pre-post study design to assess health providers’ perspectives of a multi-component intervention (the Heshima project), which aimed to mitigate aspects of disrespect and abuse during facility-based childbirth. Providers working in maternity units at study facilities were interviewed using a two-part quantitative questionnaire: an interviewer-guided section on knowledge and practice, and a self-administered section focusing on intrinsic value systems and perceptions. Eleven distinct composite scores were created on client rights and care, provider emotional wellbeing, and work environments. Bivariate analyses compared pre- and post-scores. Qualitative in-depth interviews focused on underlying factors that affected provider attitudes and behaviors including the complexities of service delivery, and perceptions of the Heshima interventions. Composite scales were developed on provider knowledge of client rights (Chronbach α = 0.70), client-centered care (α = 0.80), and HIV care (α = 0.81); providers’ emotional health (α = 0.76) and working relationships (α = 0.88); and provider perceptions of management (α = 0.93), job fairness (α = 0.68), supervision (α = 0.84), promotion (α = 0.83), health systems (α = 0.85), and work environment (α = 0.85). Comparison of baseline and endline individual item scores and composite scores showed that provider knowledge of client rights and practice of a rights-based approach, treatment of clients living with HIV, and client-centered care during labor, delivery, and postnatal periods improved (p < 0.001). Changes in emotional health, perceptions of management, job fairness, supervision, and promotion seen in composite scores did not directly align with changes in item-specific responses. Qualitative data reveal health system challenges limit the translation of providers’ positive attitudes and behaviors into implementation of a rights-based approach to maternity care. Behavior change interventions, central to promoting respectful care, are feasible to implement, as seen in the Heshima experience, but require sustained interaction with health systems where providers practice.

In this way, FAIR is aiding digital transformation. The ‘FAIRification’ of data increases the interoperability and (re)usability of data, so that new and robust analytical tools, such as machine learning (ML) models, can access the data to deduce meaningful insights, extract actionable information, and identify hidden patterns. This article aims to build a FAIR ML model pipeline using the generic FAIRification workflow to make the whole ML analytics process FAIR. Accordingly, FAIR input data was modelled using a FAIR ML model. The output data from the FAIR ML model was also made FAIR. For this, a hybrid hierarchical k-means (HHK) clustering ML algorithm was applied to group the data into homogeneous subgroups and ascertain the underlying structure of the data using a Nigerian-based FAIR dataset that contains data on economic factors, healthcare facilities, and coronavirus occurrences in all the 36 states of Nigeria. The model showed that research data and the ML pipeline can be FAIRified, shared, and reused by following the proposed FAIRification workflow and implementing technical architecture.</jats:p>",Workflow; Interoperability; Computer science; Pipeline (software); Usability; Analytics; Data model (GIS); Data mining; Data transformation; Data modeling; Database; Reuse; Data science; Artificial intelligence; World Wide Web; Engineering; Data warehouse; Human–computer interaction; Programming language; Waste management,,,10.1162/dint_a_00182,true

There is a significant gap in the nursing literature about the significant contributions of executive military nurse leaders. The purpose of the interview with Brigadier General (Brig Gen) Hale O'Connor was to explore the personal stories, experiences, leadership strategies, lessons learned, and impact of her leadership on the future development of nursing as a profession. Methods The oral history method provided a framework for the interview and the analysis. In compliance with the Oral History Association guidelines, the primary investigator obtained Institutional Review Board permission, participant informed consent, and an audiotaped interview. A graduate research assistant transcribed the 3-hour audiotaped interview verbatim. The participant reviewed the transcription, provided clarification, and validated accuracy. Three independent coders extracted prevalent themes and subthemes during analysis. Researchers compared findings and reached a consensus when resolving minor discrepancies. Results Two broad thematic qualities, commitment to duty and fairness, emerged from the data with their respective subthemes. Subthemes of trust, patriotism, loyalty, and assiduousness supported the main theme of commitment to duty. Pillars of alignment, equality, and advocacy supported the broad theme of fairness. Conclusion Although the team did not use the Reina Trust Model as a framework, the trust-building behaviors emerged from the transcribed interview during the analysis. Surprisingly, many of the leadership strategies utilized by Brig Gen Hale O'Connor fit well into the Reina Trust Model, published 25 years following O'Connor's tenure as Chief, Air Force Nurse Corps.

Bhuyan; Sandra Bailey-Deleeuw; David K. Wyant; Cyril F. Chang,"Electronic health records (EHRs) have been promoted as a mechanism to overcome the fragmented healthcare system in the United States. The challenge that is being discussed is the rights of the patient to control the access to their EHRs' data and the needs of healthcare professionals to know health data to make the best treatment decisions for their patients. The Federal Trade Commission has asked those who store consumer information to comply with the Fair Information Practice Principles. In the EHR context, these principles give the rights to the patient to control who can see their health data and what components of the data are restricted from view. Control is not limited to patients, as it also includes parents of adolescent children. We suggest that the ongoing policy discussion include consideration of the precise questions patients will be asked when a need for data sharing arises. Further, patients should understand the relative risks that they face, and the degree to which their decisions will (or will not) significantly reduce the risk of a data breach.

Heterogeneity among China's middle-aged and elderly.,2017,journal article,Social science & medicine (1982),Elsevier Limited,United Kingdom,Anwen Zhang; Zlatko Nikoloski; Elias Mossialos,"China's recent healthcare reforms aim to provide fair and affordable health services for its huge population. In this paper, we investigate the association between China's health insurance and out-of-pocket (OOP) healthcare expenditure. We further explore the heterogeneity in this association. Using data of 32,387 middle-aged and elderly individuals drawn from the 2011 and 2013 waves of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we report five findings. First, having health insurance increases the likelihood of utilizing healthcare and reduces inpatient OOP expenditure. Second, healthcare benefits are distributed unevenly: while low- and medium-income individuals are the main beneficiaries with reduced OOP expenditure, those faced with very high medical bills are still at risk, owing to limited and shallow coverage in certain aspects. Third, rural migrants hardly benefit from having health insurance, suggesting that institutional barriers are still in place. Fourth, health insurance does not increase patient visits to primary care facilities; hospitals are still the main provider of healthcare. Nonetheless, there is some evidence that patients shift from higher-tier to lower-tier hospitals. Last, OOP spending on pharmaceuticals is reduced for inpatient care but not for outpatient care, suggesting that people rely on inpatient care to obtain reimbursable drugs, putting further pressure on the already overcrowded hospitals. Our findings suggest that China's health insurance system has been effective in boosting healthcare utilization and lowering OOP hospitalization expenditure, but there still remain challenges due to the less generous rural scheme, shallow outpatient care coverage, lack of insurance portability, and an underdeveloped primary healthcare system.",Self-insurance; Ambulatory care; Health care; China; Inpatient care; Longitudinal study; Population; Health policy; Medicine; Environmental health,China; Health insurance; Healthcare utilization; Migrant; Out-of-pocket expenditure,"Aged; China; Female; Health Care Reform/trends; Health Expenditures/standards; Humans; Insurance, Health/statistics & numerical data; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Primary Health Care/statistics & numerical data; Surveys and Questionnaires; Transients and Migrants/statistics & numerical data",10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.08.005,true

Healthcare systems tend to be organised around medical conditions, and the patient is often faced with a series of uncoordinated visits to multiple specialties. Ideally, care should be organised around the patient's needs. AIM The purpose of this article was to highlight some ethical challenges perceived by leaders with responsibility for management and service distribution, finance and ensuring quality of community health services for older people. METHOD This study had a qualitative design with a qualitative content analysis of one focus group with six leaders that met four times in total. Leaders from the community healthcare sector in one Norwegian municipality were included, representing both nursing homes and home-based health care. The study followed the intentions of the Declaration of Helsinki and standard ethical principles. The Norwegian Social Science Data Services approved the study. All participants voluntarily gave written informed consent. FINDINGS The main theme that emerged from this study was the ethical challenge leaders felt in the form of an inherent conflict between a caring rationale versus economic or technological rationales. Four categories emerged: (i) Management: quality versus economy; (ii) Prioritisation: fair distribution of healthcare services; (iii) Responsibility: considering individuals' needs versus the needs of the whole community; and (iv) Welfare technology: possibilities and challenges. CONCLUSION Leaders' responsibilities in community health care for older people need to strike a balance between ethical principles in the management of limited resources.",Welfare; Nursing; Health care; Qualitative research; Community health; Declaration of Helsinki; Service (business); Focus group; Informed consent; Medicine,elderly care; ethical challenges; home health care; nursing homes; qualitative research,"Administrative Personnel/psychology; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude of Health Personnel; Community Health Services/ethics; Female; Focus Groups; Homes for the Aged/ethics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Norway; Nursing Homes/ethics; Qualitative Research; Quality of Health Care/ethics",10.1111/scs.12490,false

Keith McInnes; A. Rani Elwy,"Importance Compared with the general population, veterans are at high risk for COVID-19 and have a complex relationship with the government. This potentially affects their attitudes toward receiving COVID-19 vaccines. Objective To assess veterans' attitudes toward and intentions to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Design, setting, and participants This cross-sectional web-based survey study used data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients' Veterans Insight Panel, fielded between March 12 and 28, 2021. Of 3420 veterans who were sent a link to complete a 58-item web-based survey, 1178 veterans (34%) completed the survey. Data were analyzed from April 1 to August 25, 2021. Exposures Veterans eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. Main outcomes and measures The outcomes of interest were veterans' experiences with COVID-19, vaccination status and intention groups, reasons for receiving or not receiving a vaccine, self-reported health status, and trusted and preferred sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines. Reasons for not getting vaccinated were classified into categories of vaccine deliberation, dissent, distrust, indifference, skepticism, and policy and processes. Results Among 1178 respondents, 974 (83%) were men, 130 (11%) were women, and 141 (12%) were transgender or nonbinary; 58 respondents (5%) were Black, 54 veterans (5%) were Hispanic or Latino, and 987 veterans (84%) were non-Hispanic White. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 66.7 (10.1) years. A total of 817 respondents (71%) self-reported being vaccinated against COVID-19. Of 339 respondents (29%) who were not vaccinated, those unsure of getting vaccinated were more likely to report fair or poor overall health (32 respondents [43%]) and mental health (33 respondents [44%]) than other nonvaccinated groups (overall health: range, 20%-32%; mental health: range, 18%-40%). Top reasons for not being vaccinated were skepticism (120 respondents [36%] were concerned about side effects; 65 respondents [20%] preferred using few medications; 63 respondents [19%] preferred gaining natural immunity), deliberation (74 respondents [22%] preferred to wait because vaccine is new), and distrust (61 respondents [18%] did not trust the health care system). Among respondents who were vaccinated, preventing oneself from getting sick (462 respondents [57%]) and contributing to the end of the COVID-19 pandemic (453 respondents [56%]) were top reasons for getting vaccinated. All veterans reported the VA as 1 of their top trusted sources of information. The proportion of respondents trusting their VA health care practitioner as a source of vaccine information was higher among those unsure about vaccination compared with those who indicated they would definitely not or probably not get vaccinated (18 respondents [26%] vs 15 respondents [15%]). There were no significant associations between vaccine intention groups and age (χ24 = 5.90; P = .21) or gender (χ22 = 3.99; P = .14). Conclusions and relevance These findings provide information needed to develop trusted messages used in conversations between VA health care practitioners and veterans addressing specific vaccine hesitancy reasons, as well as those in worse health. Conversations need to emphasize societal reasons for getting vaccinated and benefits to one's own health.",Mental health; Cross-sectional study; Government; Health care; Vaccination; Veterans Affairs; Transgender; Population; Family medicine; Medicine,,Adult; Aged; Attitude; COVID-19/mortality; COVID-19 Vaccines/immunology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States/epidemiology; Vaccination/psychology; Veterans/psychology,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.32548,true

Han; Catherine Hudson; Eunhee Chung; Chwan-Li Shen,"Very few studies have investigated differences in musculoskeletal health due to gender in a large rural population. The aim of this study is to investigate factors affecting musculoskeletal health in terms of hand grip strength, musculoskeletal discomfort, and gait disturbance in a rural-dwelling, multi-ethnic cohort. Data for 1117 participants (40 years and older, 70 % female) of an ongoing rural healthcare study, Project FRONTIER, were analyzed. Subjects with a history of neurological disease, stroke and movement disorder were excluded. Dominant hand grip strength was assessed by dynamometry. Gait disturbance including stiff, spastic, narrow-based, wide-based, unstable or shuffling gait was rated. Musculoskeletal discomfort was assessed by self-reported survey. Data were analyzed by linear, logistic regression and negative binomial regressions as appropriate. Demographic and socioeconomic factors were adjusted in the multiple variable analyses. In both genders, advanced age was a risk factor for weaker hand grip strength; arthritis was positively associated with musculoskeletal discomfort, and fair or poor health was significantly associated with increased risk of gait disturbance. Greater waist circumference was associated with greater musculoskeletal discomfort in males only. In females, advanced age is the risk factor for musculoskeletal discomfort as well as gait disturbance. Females with fair or poor health had weaker hand grip strength. Higher C-reactive protein and HbA1c levels were also positively associated with gait disturbance in females, but not in males. This cross-sectional study demonstrates how gender affects hand grip strength, musculoskeletal discomfort, and gait in a rural-dwelling multi-ethnic cohort.

Despite best efforts, it is difficult to reconcile all competing interests and trade-offs are inevitable. This is why multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) has played a major role in recent uptake of value-based reimbursement. MCDA framework enables exploration of stakeholders’ preferences, as well as explicit organization of broad range of criteria on which real-world decisions are made. Assessment and appraisal of orphan drugs tend to be one of the most complicated health technology assessment (HTA) tasks. Access to market approved orphan therapies remains an issue. Early constructive dialogue among rare disease stakeholders and elaboration of orphan drug-tailored decision support tools could set the scene for ongoing accumulation of evidence, as well as for proper reimbursement decision-making. Objective: The objective of this study was to create a MCDA value measurement model to assess and appraise orphan drugs. This was achieved by exploring the preferences on decision criteria’s weights and performance scores through a stakeholder-representative survey and a focus group discussion that were both organized in Bulgaria. Results/Conclusions: Decision criteria that describe the health technology’s characteristics were unanimously agreed as the most important group of reimbursement considerations. This outcome, combined with the high individual weight of disease severity and disease burden criteria underlined some of the fundamental principles of healthcare – equity and fairness. Our study proved that strength of evidence may be a key criterion in orphan drug assessment and appraisal. Evidence is not only used to shape reimbursement decision-making, but also to lend legitimacy to policies pursued. The need for real-world data on orphan drugs was largely stressed. Improved knowledge on MCDA feasibility and integration to HTA is of paramount importance, as progress in medicine and innovative health technologies should correspond to patient, healthcare system and societal values.",Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Risk analysis (engineering); Health care; Decision analysis; Health technology; Equity (finance); Reimbursement; Disease burden; Management science; Medicine; Orphan drug,decision-making; health technology assessment; multi-criteria decision analysis; orphan drugs; rare diseases; reimbursement,,10.3389/fpubh.2016.00214,true

We sought to assess the level of knowledge of cardiovascular risk factors and describe the perception of coronary intervention among the general population in the city of Jeddah in the western part of Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in the city of Jeddah during the period from April 2019 to September 1, 2019, by using a structured online questionnaire to assess the participants' awareness of risk factors for CAD and coronary intervention. The survey included questions about socio-demographic data, risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, symptoms of heart attack, knowledge of coronary catheterizations, as well as resources of knowledge about coronary heart disease. Results The study included 984 participants. The majority of the participants had university diplomas (78.1%). Only 38.5 % were healthcare workers. Dyslipidemia and smoking were identified by 70.5% and 66.7%, respectively, as a recognized risk factor for CAD. Diabetes was mentioned by 32.1%. Participants without CAD risk factors had a significantly lower level of knowledge regarding the strong association between diabetes mellitus (DM) II and CAD (p-value=0.02). Healthcare professionals had a significantly lower level of knowledge regarding cardiac catheterization as compared to non-healthcare professionals. A higher percentage of healthcare professionals would agree to have cardiac catheterization if indicated (p-value=0.003).

COVID-19 and related mitigation strategies may have exacerbated avoidance, and poor mental health may be bidirectionally related to avoiding care. This study estimated the prevalence of primary care avoidance during the pandemic in a national sample of trans and non-binary people in Canada with a primary care provider and examined the association between poorer self-rated mental health and avoidance. In Fall 2019, Trans PULSE Canada collected multi-mode survey data from trans and non-binary people. In September to October 2020, 820 participants completed a COVID-19-focused survey. In this cross-sectional analysis, multivariable logistic regression models estimated odds ratios adjusted for confounders and weighted to the 2019 sample. The analysis included 689 individuals with a primary healthcare provider, of whom 61.2% (95% CI: 57.2, 65.2) reported fair or poor mental health and 25.7% (95% CI: 22.3, 29.2) reported care avoidance during the pandemic. The most common reason for avoidance was having a non-urgent health concern (72.7%, 95% CI: 65.9, 79.5).

A strong partnership between the patient and healthcare practitioners should help to achieve effective treatment outcomes. Objective To assess concordance of views between patients with psoriasis and their treating dermatologists relative to psoriasis severity, presence of symptoms and satisfaction with disease control achieved. Methods We used data from the Growth from Knowledge (GfK) Disease Atlas real-world evidence program, a syndicated, retrospective, cross-sectional survey among dermatologists and their systemic therapy eligible patients with psoriasis, conducted across nine countries. Concordance was measured through patients and their dermatologist's identical answers to the same survey questions. Concordance was evaluated using percentage agreement between dermatologists and their patients, and Cohen's kappa (κ) statistic. The level of concordance was defined as 'none' (κ ≤ 0), 'none to slight' (0.01-0.20), 'fair' (0.21-0.40), 'moderate' (0.41-0.60), 'substantial' (0.61-0.80) and 'almost perfect' (>0.8). The analysis was conducted for the overall population and for each participating country. Results Overall, 524 dermatologists and 3821 patients with psoriasis were included in the survey. Concordance of patient and dermatologist perceptions of psoriasis severity was fair both at diagnosis, and at the time of the survey (61% agreement, κ = 0.326 and 55% agreement, κ = 0.370, respectively). Higher levels of concordance were reported when patients assessed their psoriasis as moderate-to-severe (using Investigator's Global Assessment/Physician's Global Assessment [IGA/PGA] 5-point scale of 3 or 4). Concordance regarding symptoms ranged from fair to moderate (κ = 0.241-0.575). Satisfaction with psoriasis control was fair (39% agreement, κ = 0.213).

Studies based solely on the ICD coding manual may underestimate the prevalence of DD. Real-world use of rehabilitation data may be useful in the identification of more DD children previously undiagnosed with DD. AIM The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of DD among children aged 0-6 by age and sex in Taiwan based on modified ICD codes. METHODS A list of ICD codes specific to DD (including delays and disabilities requiring early intervention) was generated from the existing ICD codebook and modified based on National Health Insurance (NHI) claims data pertaining to developmental rehabilitation of children aged 0-6. The validity of the codes was subsequently assessed by DD experts in various fields using the consensus development technique. The resulting list was used to estimate the prevalence of DD among children in Taiwan from 2000 to 2015 based on analysis of longitudinal NHI data. RESULT Between 2000 and 2015, the prevalence of DD among children aged 0 to 6 years increased from 2.0% to 5.7%, and the sex ratio was 181-197 males per 100 females. The prevalence estimate obtained in this study (5.6%) was 229% higher than existing government statistics (1.6%) published in 2014. CONCLUSIONS The codes developed using claims data in this study can be used to estimate the prevalence of DD among children and evaluate the effectiveness of intervention programmes. Consistent increases in the prevalence of DD indicate that efforts to promote early intervention have been effective. Nonetheless, the low prevalence rate among 0-2 years children with developmental delay and low prevalence rate of female CWDD means that the policy should notice the lack of access to healthcare services for infants and female children and produce a more equitable or fair distribution of healthcare resources.",Demography; Health care; Prevalence; Rehabilitation; Intervention (counseling); Developmental Milestone; National health insurance; National study; Administrative database; Medicine,children with developmental delay (CWDD); developmental delay (DD); disabled children; prevalence,"Child; Developmental Disabilities/diagnosis; Early Intervention, Educational; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; National Health Programs; Prevalence; Taiwan/epidemiology",10.1111/cch.12932,false

National and international triage guidelines emerged from professional and governmental bodies and have led to controversial discussions about which criteria-e.g. medical prognosis, age, life-expectancy or quality of life-are ethically acceptable. The paper presents the main points of agreement and disagreement in triage protocols and reviews the ethical debate surrounding them. SOURCES OF DATA: Published articles, news articles, book chapters, ICU triage guidelines set out by professional societies and health authorities. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Points of agreement in the guidelines that are widely supported by ethical arguments are (i) to avoid using a first come, first served policy or quality-adjusted life-years and (ii) to rely on medical prognosis, maximizing lives saved, justice as fairness and non-discrimination. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Points of disagreement in existing guidelines and the ethics literature more broadly regard the use of exclusion criteria, the role of life expectancy, the prioritization of healthcare workers and the reassessment of triage decisions. GROWING POINTS: Improve outcome predictions, possibly aided by Artificial intelligence (AI); develop participatory approaches to drafting, assessing and revising triaging protocols; learn from experiences with implementation of guidelines with a view to continuously improve decision-making. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Examine the universality vs. context-dependence of triaging principles and criteria; empirically test the appropriateness of triaging guidelines, including impact on vulnerable groups and risk of discrimination; study the potential and challenges of AI for outcome and preference prediction and decision-support.",Life expectancy; Professional association; Psychology; Nursing; Health care; Bioethics; Justice (ethics); Triage; Test (assessment); Intensive care,COVID-19; ICU triage; ethics; guidelines; resource allocation,COVID-19/epidemiology; Clinical Protocols; Critical Care/ethics; Humans; Triage/ethics,10.1093/bmb/ldab009,true

Hanchate; Michael Shwartz,"To overcome the limitations of administrative data in adequately adjusting for differences in patients’ risk of readmissions, recent studies have added supplemental data from patient surveys and other sources (e.g., electronic health records). However, judging the adequacy of enhanced risk adjustment for use in assessment of 30-day readmission as a hospital quality indicator is not straightforward. In this paper, we evaluate the adequacy of risk adjustment by comparing the one-year costs of those readmitted within 30 days to those not after excluding the costs of the readmission. In this two-step study, we first used comprehensive administrative and survey data on a nationally representative Medicare cohort of hospitalized patients to compare patients with a medical admission who experienced a 30-day readmission to patients without a readmission in terms of their overall Medicare payments during 12 months following the index discharge. We then examined the extent to which a series of enhanced risk adjustment models incorporating code-based comorbidities, self-reported health status and prior healthcare utilization, reduced the payment differences between the admitted and not readmitted groups. Our analytic cohort consisted 4684 index medical hospitalization of which 842 met the 30-day readmission criteria. Those readmitted were more likely to be older, White, sicker and with higher healthcare utilization in the previous year. The unadjusted subsequent one-year Medicare spending among those readmitted ($56,856) was 60% higher than that among the non-readmitted ($35,465). Even with enhanced risk adjustment, and across a variety of sensitivity analyses, one-year Medicare spending remained substantially higher (46.6%, p < 0.01) among readmitted patients. Enhanced risk adjustment models combining health status indicators from administrative and survey data with previous healthcare utilization are unable to substantially reduce the cost differences between those medical admission patients readmitted within 30 days and those not. The unmeasured patient severity that these cost differences most likely reflect raises the question of the fairness of programs that place large penalties on hospitals with higher than expected readmission rates.",Health administration; Public health; Health informatics; Emergency medicine; Survey data collection; Risk adjustment; In patient; Nursing research; Medicine; Cohort,30-day readmissions; Disease severity; Utilization,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Comorbidity; Costs and Cost Analysis; Economics, Hospital; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Health Expenditures; Health Status; Hospitalization/economics; Hospitals/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Male; Medicare/economics; Middle Aged; Patient Discharge/economics; Patient Readmission/economics; Risk Adjustment/economics; United States",10.1186/s12913-019-3983-7,true

Lester; Carlo A. Marra; Mia L. van der Kop; Paul Ritvo; Lidia Engel; Sarah Karanja; Larry D. Lynd,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health state utility value (HSUV) measurements are vital components of healthcare clinical and economic evaluations. Accurate measurement of HSUV and HRQoL require validated instruments. The 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) is one of few instruments that can evaluate both HRQoL and HSUV, but its validity has not been assessed in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in east Africa, where the burden of HIV is high. This cross-sectional study used baseline data from a randomized trial involving PLWHA in Kenya. Data included responses from a translated and adapted SF-12 survey as well as key demographic and clinical data. Construct validity of the survey was examined by testing the SF-12’s ability to distinguish between groups known in advance to have differences in their health based on their disease severity. We classified disease severity based on established definitions from the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) and WHO, as well as a previously studied viral load threshold. T-tests and ANOVA were used to test for differences in HRQoL and HSUV scores. Area under the receive operator curve (AUC) was used to test the discriminative ability of the HRQoL and HSUV instruments. Differences in physical component scores met the minimum clinically important difference among participants with more advanced HIV when defined by CD4 count (4.3 units) and WHO criteria (compared to stage 1, stages 2, 3 and 4 were 2.0, 7.2 and 9.8 units lower respectively). Mental score differences met the minimum clinically important difference between WHO stage 1 and stage 4 patients (4.4). Differences in the HSUV were statistically lower in more advanced HIV by all three definitions of severity. The AUC showed poor to weak discriminatory ability in most analyses, but had fair discriminatory ability between WHO clinical stage 1 and clinical stage 4 individuals (AUC = 0.71). Our findings suggest that the Kiswahili translated and adapted version of the SF-12 could be used as an assessment tool for physical health, mental health and HSUV for Kiswahili-speaking PLHWA.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) who are continuously exposed to different body fluids are at an increased risk of contracting and transmitting this virus. It is thus important to evaluate the knowledge and attitude of HCWs towards HBV and the prevalence of HBV infection among them. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out between April and September 2017. Overall, 398 HCWs were recruited for this study. Knowledge on the route of HBV transmission and attitude towards HBV were evaluated using a well-structured questionnaire. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity was obtained using the Monolisa HBsAg ULTRA kit (Bio-Rad). Data were analysed using SPSS V.20. Results Among the HCWs who participated in this study, 338 (84.9%) had heard of HBV, and 269 (67.6%) of them had adequate knowledge on the route of HBV transmission. Medical doctors were the most knowledgeable among biomedical workers and students (76.5%). The rate of stigma was highest among nurses (87, 38.8%). The prevalence of HBsAg positivity was high (42, 10.6%) given that there is an efficient and available vaccine. Overall, over 70% of HCWs invited to participate in this study responded. Conclusion Knowledge on the route of HBV transmission was fair, and the level of stigmatisation of HBV-infected patients and the prevalence of HBV infection were high in this study. A sensitisation campaign should be carried out to educate HCWs on HBV, thus reducing the level of stigma associated with HBV as well as the probability of contracting HBV as a nosocomial infection.",Health care; HBsAg; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis b surface antigen; Increased risk; Hospital based study; Hbsag positivity; Medicine; Environmental health,Cameroon; HBV; HBsAg; attitude; health care workers; knowledge,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cameroon/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Hepatitis B/epidemiology; Hepatitis B virus; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Young Adult",10.1136/bmjopen-2019-031075,true

This study aims to identify the determinants of hospital efficiency and explore how to improve the performance of MCHH in terms of productivity and efficiency. Data was collected from a sample of 32 county-level MCHHs of Guangxi in 2014. Firstly, we specified and measured the indicators of the inputs and outputs which represent hospital resources expended and its profiles respectively. Then we estimated the efficiency scores using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for each hospital. Efficiency scores were decomposed into technical, scale and congestion components, and the potential output increases and/or input reductions were also estimated in this model, which would make relatively inefficient hospitals more efficient. In the second stage, the estimated efficiency scores are regressed against hospital external and internal environment factors using a Tobit model. We used DEAP (V2.1) and R for data analysis. The average scores of technical efficiency, net technical efficiency (managerial efficiency) and scale efficiency of the hospitals were 0.875, 0.922 and 0.945, respectively. Half of the hospitals were efficient, and 9.4 % and 40.6 % were weakly efficient and inefficient, respectively. Among the low-productiveness hospitals, 61.1 % came from poor counties (Poor counties in this article are in the list of key poverty-stricken counties at the national level, published by The State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development, 2012). The total input indicated that redundant medical resources in poverty areas were significantly higher than those in non-poverty areas. The Tobit regression model showed that the technical efficiency was proportional to the total annual incomes, the number of discharge patients, and the number of outpatient and emergency visits, while it was inversely proportional to total expenditure and the actual number of open beds. Technical efficiency was not associated with number of health care workers. The overall operational efficiency of the county-level MCHHs in Guangxi was low and needs to be improved. Regional economic differences affect the performances of hospitals. Health administrations should adjust and optimize the resource investments for the different areas. For the hospitals in poverty areas, policy-makers should not only consider the hardware facilities investment, but also the introduction of advanced techniques and high-level medical personnel to improve their technical efficiency.",Health care; Tobit model; Poverty; Productivity; Data envelopment analysis; Operational efficiency; Health services research; Socioeconomics; Health policy; Medicine; Environmental health,County-level maternal and child health hospital; Data envelopment analysis; Influencing factors; Technical efficiency; Tobit,"Adult; Child; Child Health Services/organization & administration; Child Welfare/statistics & numerical data; China; Efficiency, Organizational/statistics & numerical data; Female; Health Expenditures; Health Resources; Hospitals, Public/organization & administration; Humans; Maternal Health Services/organization & administration; Poverty/statistics & numerical data; Pregnancy",10.1186/s12939-016-0420-y,true

This rapid review synthesizes HRO frameworks, metrics, and implementation effects to help inform health systems' efforts toward becoming HROs. Methods Bibliographic databases were searched from 2010 to 2019. One reviewer used prespecified criteria to assess articles for inclusion, evaluate study quality, extract data, and grade strength of evidence with second reviewer checking. Results Twenty-three articles were identified: 8 described frameworks, 9 examined metrics, and 9 evaluated implementation outcomes. Five common strategies for HRO implementation emerged (developing leadership, supporting a culture of safety, providing training and learning, building data systems, and implementing quality improvement interventions). The Joint Commission's and Institute for Healthcare Improvement's frameworks emerged as the most comprehensive and widely applicable. The Joint Commission's Oro 2.0 metric for evaluating HRO progress similarly stood out as it was developed through broad stakeholder input and was validated by external researchers. Multicomponent HRO interventions delivered for at least 2 years were associated with improved process and patient safety outcomes. Because each HRO intervention was only supported by a single poor or fair-quality study-none of which contained a concurrent control group-a causal relationship between any HRO initiative and outcomes could not be established. Conclusions Health care system adoption of HRO principles is associated with improved safety outcomes, yet the level of evidence is low.

The treatment and management of complex chronic diseases, such as diabetes, stands to benefit from novel AI algorithms analyzing the frequent real-time streaming data and the occasional medical diagnostics and laboratory test results reported in electronic health records (EHR). Novel algorithms are needed to develop trustworthy, responsible, reliable, and robust AI techniques that can handle the imperfect and imbalanced data of EHRs and inconsistencies or discrepancies with free-living self-reported information. The challenges and applications of AI for two problems in the healthcare domain were explored in this work. First, we introduced novel AI algorithms for EHRs designed to be fair and unbiased while accommodating privacy concerns in predicting treatments and outcomes. Then, we studied the innovative approach of using machine learning to improve automated insulin delivery systems through analyzing real-time information from wearable devices and historical data to identify informative trends and patterns in free-living data.

Trend changes were attributed to decreased cases of diarrhea and gastroenteritis, abdominal and pelvic pain, essential hypertension and fever of unknown origin. A shift from medium to short-stay cases for specific diagnoses was also detected. Level changes were attributed to improved coding practices, particularly for breast cancer, leukemia and chemotherapy. No impact on surgical casemix index was found.</ns3:p><ns3:p> <ns3:bold>Conclusions</ns3:bold>: The 2014 policy resulted in increased healthcare effectiveness, by increasing the casemix index of hospitals contracted by the Ministry.

The aim of this study was to understand the general level of dementia knowledge and attitudes towards dementia in different types of hospital staff, as well as to explore the potential influence of previous dementia training and experience (having a family member with dementia) and the potential moderating effects of personal characteristics. This data was required to plan and deliver general and targeted educational interventions to raise awareness of dementia throughout the acute services. A cross-sectional survey was carried out among a diverse range of hospital staff (n = 1795) in three urban acute general hospitals in Ireland, including doctors, nurses, healthcare attendants, allied professionals, and general support staff. Participants’ perceived dementia knowledge and attitudes were assessed as well as their previous dementia training and experience. To measure participant’s attitude towards dementia, the validated Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire (ADQ) was used. Hospital staff demonstrated positive attitudes towards people living with dementia, and believed they had a fair to moderate understanding of dementia. Both ‘having previous dementia training’ and ‘having a relative living with dementia’ predicted attitude towards dementia and perceived dementia knowledge. Interestingly, certain personal staff characteristics did impact dementia training in predicting attitude towards dementia and perceived dementia knowledge. This study provides a baseline of data regarding the attitudes towards dementia and perceived dementia knowledge for hospital staff in Irish acute hospitals. The results can inform educational initiatives that target different hospital staff, in order to increase awareness and knowledge to improve quality of dementia care in Irish hospitals.",Cross-sectional study; Health care; Rehabilitation; Dementia; Irish; Family member; Educational interventions; Acute hospital; Medicine; Gerontology,Acute hospital; Approaches to dementia questionnaire; Dementia; Dementia knowledge; Staff attitudes,"Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dementia/diagnosis; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Ireland/epidemiology; Personnel, Hospital; Surveys and Questionnaires",10.1186/s12877-020-01783-6,true

We then use China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data from 1997 to 2006 to calculate the fairness gap. (3) Results: Empirical analysis using CHNS data shows that the ratio of the fairness gap to the directly observed average urban-rural difference in healthcare was 1.167 for 1997-2000 and 1.744 for 2004-2006. The average urban-rural difference observed directly from original statistical data may have underestimated the degree of this essential inequity. (4) Conclusions: Our findings suggest that upgrading urban-rural reimbursement ratios may not be sufficient in eliminating the inequality of opportunity in healthcare utilization between urban and rural residents.

Thus, the data were collected from 275 employees working in healthcare institutions, the education sector, and the Ministry of Defense in Kuwait. Overall, the results show a significant and direct impact of overqualification and life satisfaction on employees’ job performance; accordingly, employees’ job performance also affects organizational commitment. Thus, results indicate that person-job fit negatively affects employees’ job performance.

Barry; Dylan Keeley; James F. O’Mahony,"We surveyed evidence published by Ireland’s National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) on the cost-effectiveness of cancer drugs approved for funding within the Irish public healthcare system. The purpose is threefold: to assess the completeness and clarity of publicly available cost-effectiveness data of such therapies; to provide summary estimates of that data; to consider the implications of constraints on data availability for accountability regarding healthcare resource allocation. The National Cancer Control Programme lists 91 drug-indication pairs approved between June 2012 and July 2020. Records were retrieved from the NCPE website for each drug-indication pair, including, where available, health technology assessment (HTA) summary reports. We assessed what cost-effectiveness data regarding approved interventions is available, aggregated it and considered the consequences of reporting constraints. Among the 91 drug-indication pairs 61 were reimbursed following full HTA, 22 after a rapid review process and 8 have no corresponding NCPE record. Of the 61 where an HTA report was available, 41 presented costs and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) estimates of the interventions compared. Cost estimates and corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are based on prices on application for reimbursement. Reimbursed prices are not published. Aggregating over the drug-indication pairs for which data is available, we find a mean incremental health gain of 0.85 QALY and an aggregate ICER of €100,295/QALY, which exceeds Ireland’s cost-effectiveness threshold of €45,000/QALY. Reimbursement applications by pharmaceutical manufacturers for cancer drugs typically exceed Ireland’s cost-effectiveness threshold, often by a considerable margin. On aggregate, the additional total net cost of new drugs relative to current treatments needs to be more than halved for the prices sought on application to be justified for reimbursement.

Baker; Richard W. Grant; Anjali Gopalan,"Evidence supporting the effectiveness of care management programs for complex patients has been inconclusive. However, past reviews have not focused on complexity primarily defined by multimorbidity and healthcare utilization. We conducted a systematic review of care management interventions targeting the following three patient groups: adults with two or more chronic medical conditions, adults with at least one chronic medical condition and concurrent depression, and adults identified based solely on high past or predicted healthcare utilization. Eligible studies were identified from PubMed, published between 06/01/2005 and 05/31/2015, and reported findings from a randomized intervention that tested a comprehensive, care management intervention. Identified interventions were grouped based on the three “complex” categories of interest (described above). Two investigators extracted data using a structured abstraction form and assessed RCT quality. We screened 989 article titles for eligibility from which 847 were excluded. After reviewing the remaining 142 abstracts, 83 articles were excluded. We reviewed the full-text of 59 full-text articles and identified 15 unique RCTs for the final analysis. Of these 15 studies, two focused on patients with two or more chronic medical conditions, seven on patients with at least one chronic medical condition and depression, and six on patients with high past or predicted healthcare utilization. Measured outcomes included utilization, chronic disease measures, and patient-reported outcomes. The seven studies targeting patients with at least one chronic medical condition and depression demonstrated significant improvement in depression symptoms (ranging from 9.2 to 48.7% improvement). Of the six studies that focused on high utilizers, two showed small reductions in utilization. The quality of the research methodology in most of the studies (12/15) was rated fair or poor. Interventions were more likely to be successful when patients were selected based on having at least one chronic medical condition and concurrent depression, and when patient-reported outcomes were assessed.

A qualitative study in the UK.,2021,journal article,BMC neurology,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,United Kingdom,Nahal Mavaddat; Euan Sadler; Lisa Lim; Kate M. Williams; Elizabeth A. Warburton; Ann Louise Kinmonth; Christopher McKevitt; Jonathan Mant,"BACKGROUND Levels of self-reported health do not always correlate with levels of physical disability in stroke survivors. We aimed to explore what underlies the difference between subjective self-reported health and objectively measured disability among stroke survivors. METHODS Face to face semi-structured interviews were conducted with stroke survivors recruited from a stroke clinic or rehabilitation ward in the UK. Fifteen stroke survivors purposively sampled from the clinic who had discordant self-rated health and levels of disability i.e. reported health as 'excellent' or 'good' despite significant physical disability (eight), or as 'fair' or 'poor' despite minimal disability (seven) were compared to each other, and to a control group of 13 stroke survivors with concordant self-rated health and disability levels. Interviews were conducted 4 to 6 months after stroke and data analysed using the constant comparative method informed by Albrecht and Devlieger's concept of 'disability paradox'. RESULTS Individuals with 'excellent' or 'good' self-rated health reported a sense of self-reliance and control over their bodies, focussed on their physical rehabilitation and lifestyle changes and reported few bodily and post-stroke symptoms regardless of level of disability. They also frequently described a positive affect and optimism towards recovery. Some, especially those with 'good' self-rated health and significant disability also found meaning from their stroke, reporting a spiritual outlook including practicing daily gratitude and acceptance of limitations. Individuals with minimal disability reporting 'fair' or 'poor' self-rated health on the other hand frequently referred to their post-stroke physical symptoms and comorbidities and indicated anxiety about future recovery. These differences in psychological outlook clustered with differences in perception of relational and social context including support offered by family and healthcare professionals. CONCLUSIONS The disability paradox may be illuminated by patterns of individual attributes and relational dynamics observed among stroke survivors. Harnessing these wider understandings can inform new models of post-stroke care for evaluation.",Social environment; Qualitative research; Optimism; Rehabilitation; Physical disability; Gratitude; Stroke; Anxiety; Medicine; Gerontology,Stroke self-reported health quality of life disability,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Disability Evaluation; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Self Report; Stroke/complications; Stroke Rehabilitation; Survivors; United Kingdom/epidemiology",10.1186/s12883-021-02338-x,true

This study was conducted between 2012 and 2013 to determine the level of equity in the quality of hospital services in Iran. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 1,003 patients were chosen from 100 hospitals in Iran with multi-stage random cluster sampling. Concentration index was calculated to determine equity of healthcare quality from patients' viewpoint. Furthermore, the equity of hospital services' quality was investigated from experts' perspective by calculating Gini index based on the hospitals' accreditation scores. Analyzing the related factors was done by logistic regression. The significance level was set at α=0.05. Data were analyzed using Excel v.2010, SPSS v.21, and Stata v.8. Results: There was a significant inequity in the quality of hospital services in both patients' and experts' point of view. In fact, concentration index (95% confidence interval) for the quality of healthcare was significant, 0.128 (0.080, 0.176), indicating better quality of services for those with higher economic status from patients' point of view. Furthermore, Gini index (95% confidence interval) for hospitals' accreditation scores was 0.166 (0.156, 0.176), meaning that there was inequity in hospital services quality from experts' point of view. Conclusion: The significant inequality observed in the quality of hospital care based on the economic status of the patients highlights the necessity of the supportive policies aiming at reduction of this condition.",Socioeconomic status; Logistic regression; Health care; Confidence interval; Inequality; Family medicine; Equity (economics); Accreditation; Statistical significance; Medicine,Equality; Equity; Healthcare services; Hospital; Iran; Quality; Socio-economic status,,10.14196/mjiri.31.109,true

Erickson; Isabelle Guyon; Kristin P. Bennett,"Access to healthcare data such as electronic health records (EHR) is often restricted by laws established to protect patient privacy. These restrictions hinder the reproducibility of existing results based on private healthcare data and also limit new research. Synthetically-generated healthcare data solve this problem by preserving privacy and enabling researchers and policymakers to drive decisions and methods based on realistic data. Healthcare data can include information about multiple in- and out- patient visits of patients, making it a time-series dataset which is often influenced by protected attributes like age, gender, race etc. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated health inequities, with certain subgroups experiencing poorer outcomes and less access to healthcare. To combat these inequities, synthetic data must “fairly” represent diverse minority subgroups such that the conclusions drawn on synthetic data are correct and the results can be generalized to real data. In this article, we develop two fairness metrics for synthetic data, and analyze all subgroups defined by protected attributes to analyze the bias in three published synthetic research datasets. These covariate-level disparity metrics revealed that synthetic data may not be representative at the univariate and multivariate subgroup-levels and thus, fairness should be addressed when developing data generation methods. We discuss the need for measuring fairness in synthetic healthcare data to enable the development of robust machine learning models to create more equitable synthetic healthcare datasets.",Health care; Synthetic data; Univariate; Data science; Disparate impact; Private healthcare; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Healthcare data; Computer science; Test data generation,covariate; disparate impact; fairness; health inequities; healthcare; synthetic data; temporal; time-series,,10.3390/e23091165,true

As our climate changes, there is a growing concern that negative human-snake interactions will increase. Our ability to prevent and manage snakebite requires effective antivenoms as well as knowledge regarding the prevention and management of snakebite among healthcare workers and affected communities across the globe. This systematic review aims to assess existing levels of knowledge regarding snakebite prevention and management in both healthcare workers and affected communities.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">This review was conducted on studies reporting quantitative measurements to evaluate knowledge and practice regarding snakebite prevention and management published in major databases between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2021. Random effects modelling was used to obtain the pooled proportion. Heterogeneity (I2) was tested, and sensitivity analyses performed.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Out of 3,697 records, 16 studies from 12 countries assessing 7,640 participants were included.

This study results demonstrated that 56% of the study population answered the knowledge question correctly (95% CI 48% to 63%, p &lt; 0.001). High heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 97.29%), with marginal publication bias (Egger's regression test, p = 0.0814). Participants had relatively higher knowledge concerning use of antivenom as preferred treatment, followed by snakebite prevention, knowledge of signs and symptoms of snakebite, knowledge of first-aid, and knowledge of treatment.

Brixner; Jonathan D. Campbell; Neil Hawkins; Lars Erik Kristensen; Mata Charokopou; Irina Mountian; Boglarka Szegvari; Zoltán Kaló,"BACKGROUND: Inclusion of patient experience (PEx) in health technology assessment (HTA) has become increasingly important; however, no harmonized approach exists to help manufacturers or decision makers ensure PEx considerations are fair, consistent, and thorough within global HTA frameworks. OBJECTIVE: To develop a proposal for including PEx in the HTA frameworks of health technologies. METHODS: A systematic literature review (SLR) on existing value frameworks (VFs) was conducted to capture how PEx-related value judgment is currently considered. Guided by the results of the SLR, a research group including HTA experts and patient representatives used an iterative process to develop potential value domains to capture PEx, in accordance with international guidelines. Subsequently, a panel of international payer experts was used to challenge the proposed PEx domains and provide recommendations for implementation. RESULTS: The SLR found 61 VFs and multi-criteria decision analyses (MCDAs) that considered PEx; however, PEx-related value elements were often referred to superficially, without clear definitions. Five potential PEx domains, with proposed measures for each, were developed and refined using expert feedback: (1) responsiveness to patient's individual needs, (2) improved health literacy and empowerment, (3) patient and caregiver reported outcomes, (4) household's financial burden, and (5) improved access for vulnerable patient populations. A flexible approach for framework implementation was proposed. CONCLUSIONS: Proposed PEx domains could be implemented at multiple levels of healthcare decision making to formalize consideration of PEx in the assessment of value, either through the extension of existing VFs or to create new PEx-focused VFs and more holistic decision making tools.

Despite being in a time of vibrant cultural revitalization, Native Hawaiians have a shorter life expectancy than other racial and ethnic groups in Hawai'i. The primary aim of this paper was to share data from the first year of a 5-year study with Native Hawaiian kūpuna (elders) on their experiences with healthcare, along with barriers to accessing healthcare. Ten kūpuna living in rural areas of Hawai'i participated in three interviews each, which were held in an informal, talk-story style. The first interview focused on establishing rapport. The second interview focused on the kūpuna's strengths, resiliencies, and what they would like to pass to the next generation. The third interview focused on the elders' experiences with healthcare, which is the focus of this paper. All ten kūpuna reported growing up with limited access to Western healthcare; rather, their families successfully treated many illnesses and injuries with lā'au lapa'au (Hawaiian herbal medicine) and other traditional healing practices, as they had done for generations. As Western medicine became more prevalent and accessible, they used both, but many preferred holistic treatments such as prayer, a return to the traditional diet, and lā'au lapa'au. As a group, the kūpuna rated their health as fair to good; two had diabetes, two had cardiovascular disease, four had neuropathies, and five were cancer survivors. The kūpuna reported high turnover among providers in rural communities. Limited access to specialists often required them to travel to Honolulu for care, which was costly and especially difficult during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Regardless of provider ethnicity, the kūpuna appreciated those who took the time to get to know them as people and respected Hawaiian cultural practices. They advised that Western providers speak honestly and directly, have compassion, and build connections to patients and their communities.",Native Hawaiians; Focus group; Ethnic group; Health care; Medicine; Life expectancy; Qualitative research; Gerontology; Health equity; Psychological intervention; Family medicine; Nursing; Pacific islanders; Population; Public health; Environmental health; Sociology; Political science; Social science; Anthropology; Law,Hawai‘i; Indigenous; advice to practitioners; community; traditional healing,Aged; COVID-19/epidemiology; Delivery of Health Care; Hawaii; Humans; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; SARS-CoV-2,10.3389/fpubh.2022.787215,true

Dowdy; Holly A. Taylor; Maria W. Merritt,"Social justice is the moral imperative to avoid and remediate unfair distributions of societal disadvantage. In priority setting in healthcare and public health, social justice reaches beyond fairness in the distribution of health outcomes and economic impacts to encompass fairness in the distribution of policy impacts upon other dimensions of well-being. There is an emerging awareness of the need for economic evaluation to integrate all such concerns. We performed a systematic review (1) to describe methodological solutions suitable for integrating social justice concerns into economic evaluation, and (2) to describe the challenges that those solutions face. To be included, publications must have captured fairness considerations that (a) involve cross-dimensional subjective personal life experience and (b) can be manifested at the level of subpopulations. We identified relevant publications using an electronic search in EMBASE, PubMed, EconLit, PsycInfo, Philosopher's Index, and Scopus, including publications available in English in the past 20 years. Two reviewers independently appraised candidate publications, extracted data, and synthesized findings in narrative form. Out of 2388 publications reviewed, 26 were included. Solutions sought either to incorporate relevant fairness considerations directly into economic evaluation or to report them alongside cost-effectiveness measures. The majority of reviewed solutions, if adapted to integrate social justice concerns, would require their explicit quantification. Four broad challenges related to the implementation of these solutions were identified: clarifying the normative basis; measuring and determining the relative importance of criteria representing that basis; combining the criteria; and evaluating trade-offs. All included solutions must grapple with an inherent tension: they must either face the normative and operational challenges of quantifying social justice concerns or accede to offering incomplete policy guidance. Interdisciplinary research and broader collaborations are crucial to address these challenges and to support due attention to social justice in priority setting.",Sociology; Health care; Economic impact analysis; Economic evaluation; Disadvantage; EconLit; PsycINFO; Moral imperative; Public relations; Normative,Economic evaluation; Equity weighting; Fairness; Healthcare policy; Multicriteria decision analysis; Priority setting; Social justice; Systematic review,Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods; Delivery of Health Care/economics; Humans; Public Health/economics; Social Justice,10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.12.012,true

This study identifies the prevalence of FM in pharmacy students and professionals using three screening tools and factors associated with its development. Furthermore, this study assesses the level of agreement between the tools and the magnitude of the participants' responses to each item in the screening tools. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey conducted on members of the Saudi Pharmaceutical Society using an online questionnaire. The participants were asked to fill three questionnaires: the London Fibromyalgia Epidemiology Study Screening Questionnaire (LFESSQ), Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool (FiRST) and Fibromyalgia Survey Questionnaire (FSQ). Demographic data and factors affecting FM in pharmacy students and professionals were collected and analysed. Results Two hundred ninety-three participants accessed the survey: most of them were Saudi (93.5%) and females (78.8%) with a mean (standard deviation) age of 29 (8) years. Furthermore, 52% of the participants had generalised body pain. The prevalence of FM using FiRST, LFESSQ Pain, LFESSQ with fatigue criteria and FSQ was 27.1%, 34.9%, 50.9% and 68.4%, respectively. Fleiss' kappa coefficient revealed fair agreement among all three screening tools (kappa = 0.350; p < 0.001). After adjusting for significant variables, the resulting adjusted odds ratio of developing FM was 4.86 in people working for 41-45 h weekly (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-17.84; p = 0.017), 5.16 in people who frequently wake up during sleep (95% CI, 1.85-14.40; p = 0.002) and 12.99 in people with sleep apnea or other sleeping disorders (95% CI, 2.07-81.68; p = 0.006).

Whilst remote consultations offer many potential advantages to patients and healthcare services, they are unlikely to be suitable for all. Guidance encourages clinicians to consider patient preferences when choosing face-to-face vs remote consultations. However, little is known about acceptability of, and preferences for remote consultations, particularly amongst patients with musculoskeletal conditions. This study aimed to explore the acceptability of, and preferences for, remote consultations among patients with osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>;                <jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>Data for this study derived from three UK qualitative studies: iFraP (improving fracture prevention study), Blast Off (BO; Bisphosphonate aLternAtive regimenS for the prevenTion of Osteoporotic Fragility Fractures), and ERA (Exploring people with Rheumatoid Arthritis’ experience of the pandemic). Each study explored patient experiences of accessing and receiving healthcare during the pandemic year. Transcripts from each data set relating to remote consulting were extracted. A minimum of two study team members worked independently, following a consistent approach, to conduct a rapid deductive analysis using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA). The TFA consists of 7 constructs to understand acceptability of, in this context, remote consultations, including: affective attitudes; intervention coherence; perceived effectiveness; burden; self-efficacy; opportunity-costs; and ethicality. Following coding, the findings of all three studies were pooled.

Some participants valued the reduced burden associated with remote consultations, while others highly valued, and did not want to give up, non-verbal communication or physical examination associated with face-to-face consults (opportunity costs); although perceived need for physical examination in participants with RA was associated with strong preference for face-to-face consultations, asymptomatic participants with RA and osteoporosis also expressed similar strong preferences. Some participants described low confidence (self-efficacy) in being able to communicate in remote consultations and others perceived remote consultations as ineffective, in part due to suboptimal communication.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>;                <jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>Acceptability of, and preferences for remote consultation appear to be influenced by a range of societal, healthcare provider and personal factors and in this study, were not fixed, or condition-dependent.

047-506-537-430-494,Instruments evaluating the self-directed learning abilities among nursing students and nurses: a systematic review of psychometric properties.,2017,journal article,BMC medical education,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,United Kingdom,Lucia Cadorin; Valentina Bressan; Alvisa Palese,"Modern healthcare institutions are continuously changing, and Self-Directed Learning (SDL) abilities are considered a prerequisite for both nursing students and nurses in order to be proactive about these demanding challenges. To date, no systematic reviews of existing instruments aimed at detecting and critically evaluating SDL abilities have been published. Therefore, the aims of this review are: 1) identify the instruments for assessment of SDL abilities among nursing students and nurses; 2) critically evaluate the methodological studies quality; and 3) compare the psychometric properties of the available instruments. A psychometric-systematic-review was performed. CDSR, CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, PROSPERO, SCOPUS databases were searched without restrictions in time and setting. All primary studies involving nursing students or nurses, written in English and aimed at validating SDL assessment tools, were included. Studies retrieved were evaluated according to the COnsensus-based-Standards for the selection of health Measurement-INstruments (COSMIN) panel. Study inclusion, data extraction and quality assessment were performed by researchers independently. Eleven studies were included and four tools based on Knowles’s theory have emerged: 1) the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale; 2) the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale for Nursing Education; 3) the Self-Rating Scale of Self-Directed Learning, and 4) the Self-Directed Learning Instrument. A few psychometric properties have been considered in each study, from two to four out of the ten required. The quality of the methodologies used was in general, from fair to poor with the exception of one instrument (the Self-Directed-Learning-Instrument). The psychometric proprieties that emerged across the tools were good in general: the Cronbach α was from 0.73 to 0.91; structural validities have also reported good indexes both in the explorative and in the confirmative factor analyses. On the basis of the findings, the Self-Directed-Learning-Instrument can be recommended for the assessment of SDL abilities among nursing students and nurses, given the excellent methodology quality adopted in estimating the psychometric properties. However, rigorous study designs aimed at estimating psychometric properties of tools in wide samples of nursing students and nurses across different stages of professional life, from undergraduate education to professional maturity, in different cultural, educational, and work settings, are strongly recommended.",Cronbach's alpha; Nurse education; Inclusion (education); Nursing; Psychometrics; Systematic review; Educational measurement; CINAHL; Self-Directed Learning as Topic; Medical education; Medicine,Assessment; Nurse; Nursing education; Nursing student; Questionnaire; Self-directed learning; Systematic psychometric review; Tool,"Education, Nursing; Educational Measurement; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Humans; Learning; Nursing Education Research; Psychometrics; Self-Directed Learning as Topic; Students, Nursing",10.1186/s12909-017-1072-3,true

Methods Searches were conducted in three electronic databases (January 2005 to April 2017). Publications reporting rates of IAPEs and error types were reviewed and categorised into the following groups: component errors, dose/calculation errors, aseptic technique errors and composite errors. The methodological rigour of each study was assessed using the Hawker method. Results Of the 34 articles that met inclusion criteria, 28 reported the site of IAPEs: central pharmacies (n=8), nursing wards (n=14), both settings (n=4) and other sites (n=3). Using the Hawker criteria, 14% of the articles were of good quality, 74% were of fair quality and 12% were of poor quality. Error types and reported rates varied substantially, including wrong drug (~0% to 4.7%), wrong diluent solution (0% to 49.0%), wrong label (0% to 99.0%), wrong dose (0% to 32.6%), wrong concentration (0.3% to 88.6%), wrong diluent volume (0.06% to 49.0%) and inadequate aseptic technique (0% to 92.7%)%). Four studies directly compared incidence by preparation site and/or method, finding error incidence to be lower for doses prepared within a central pharmacy versus the nursing ward and lower for automated preparation versus manual preparation. Although eight studies (24%) reported ≥1 errors with the potential to cause patient harm, no study directly linked IAPE occurrences to specific adverse patient outcomes. Conclusions The available data suggest a need to continue to optimise the intravenous preparation process, focus on improving preparation workflow, design and implement preventive strategies, train staff on optimal admixture protocols and implement standardisation. Future research should focus on the development of consistent error subtype definitions, standardised reporting methodology and reliable, reproducible methods to track and link risk factors with the burden of harm associated with these errors.",Pharmacy; Emergency medicine; Asepsis; Harm; Drug; Train Staff; Healthcare settings; Patient harm; Incidence (epidemiology); Medicine,drug compounding; intravenous admixture preparation error; medication errors; systematic review,"Administration, Intravenous; Humans; Medication Errors/classification",10.1136/bmjopen-2017-015912,true

Moreover, outcome measures and effectiveness of trainings are systematically investigated.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">The systematic review was registered within PROSPERO (registration code: CRD42020139783). Systematic searches were performed in four databases (PubMed, Cinahl, PsycInfo, Web of Science) in 12/2020, including an update in 12/2021 and 08/2022. Quantitative, primary studies fulfilling the pre-defined inclusion criteria were included. Due to the expected heterogeneity a meta-analysis was not conducted.

McLay; Binny Thomas; Cristín Ryan; Wessam El Kassem; Rajvir Singh; Moza Al Hail,"Background In 2017, the World Health Organization published ""Medication Without Harm, WHO Global Patient Safety Challenge,"" to reduce patient harm caused by unsafe medication use practices. While the five objectives emphasise the need to create a framework for action, engaging key stakeholders and others, most published research has focused on the perspectives of health professionals. The aim was to explore the views and experiences of decision-makers in Qatar on organisational safety culture, medication errors and error reporting. Method Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with healthcare decision-makers (policy-makers, professional leaders and managers, lead educators and trainers) in Qatar. Participants were recruited via purposive and snowball sampling, continued to the point of data saturation. The interview schedule focused on: error causation and error prevention; engendering a safety culture; and initiatives to encourage error reporting. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed and independently analysed by two researchers using the Framework Approach. Results From the 21 interviews conducted, key themes were the need to: promote trust within the organisation through articulating a fair blame culture; eliminate management, professional and cultural hierarchies; focus on team building, open communication and feedback; promote professional development; and scale-up successful initiatives. There was recognition that the current medication error reporting processes and systems were suboptimal, with suggested enhancements in themes of promoting a fair blame culture and open communication. Conclusion These positive and negative aspects of organisational culture can inform the development of theory-based interventions to promote patient safety.

Several risk scores have been developed to identify older adults at risk of unplanned hospital visits. It is unclear whether risk scores developed in one country, perform as well in another. This study validates seven risk scores to predict unplanned hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits in older home care recipients from six countries. Methods: We used the IBenC sample (n = 2446), a cohort of older home care recipients from six countries (Belgium, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Italy and The Netherlands) to validate four specific risk scores (DIVERT, CARS, EARLI and previous acute admissions) and three frailty indicators (CHESS, Fried Frailty Criteria and Frailty Index). Outcome measures were unplanned hospital admissions, ED visits or any unplanned hospital visits after 6 months. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation. Performance was determined by assessing calibration and discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)). Results: Risk score performance varied across countries. In Iceland, for any unplanned hospital visits DIVERT and CARS reached a fair predictive value (AUC 0.74 [0.68–0.80] and AUC 0.74 [0.67–0.80]), respectively). In Finland, DIVERT had fair performance predicting ED visits (AUC 0.72 [0.67–0.77]) and any unplanned hospital visits (AUC 0.73 [0.67–0.77]). In other countries, AUCs did not exceed 0.70. Conclusions: Geographical validation of risk scores predicting unplanned hospital visits in home care recipients showed substantial variations of poor to fair performance across countries. Unplanned hospital visits seem considerably dependent on healthcare context. Therefore, risk scores should be validated regionally before applied to practice. Future studies should focus on identification of more discriminative predictors in order to develop more accurate risk scores.",Framingham Risk Score; Demography; Health care; Rehabilitation; Context (language use); Specific risk; Emergency department; Receiver operating characteristic; Medicine; Cohort,Emergency department visits; Geographical validation; Home care; Risk prediction models; Unplanned hospitalizations,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Emergency Service, Hospital; Frailty; Home Care Services; Hospitals; Humans; Risk Factors",10.1186/s12877-021-02521-2,true

Aim This study sought to determine patient and health system determinants of experiences of care. Setting Study was conducted at primary health care clinics in eThekwini, KwaZula-Natal. Methods A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 384 patients who received ambulatory care at six primary health care facilities (three community healthcare centres and three clinics) between June 2018 and November 2018. Results Three hundred and sixty nine respondents were included in the study. Eighty one percent (299) of the respondents were female, 67.2% (248) were single and 89.7% (331) were black Africans. Fifty (13.6%) respondents reported their health status to be poor, whilst 47 (12.5%) reported excellent health, with the majority (72.0%) reporting 'good' or 'fair' health. The patients' experience score for the study population was 89.0% (IQR 81% - 98%). Patients who attended clinics had a 6.53 (p 0.001) times increased odds of reporting good patients' experience score compared with patients who attended community healthcare centres. Although ideal clinic status had a positive association with patients' experience score (odds ration [OR]: 1.75; p 0.05) this was not significant.

Health related indirect costs are harder to measure and are often left out of the comprehensive overview of health expenses to an employer. Presenteeism, which is commonly referred to as an employee at work who has impaired productivity due to health considerations, has been identified as an indirect but relevant factor influencing productivity and human capitol. The current study evaluated presenteeism among employees of a large United States health care system that operates in six locations over a four-year period and estimated loss productivity due to poor health and its potential economic burden. The Health-Related Productivity Loss Instrument (HPLI) was included as part of an online Health Risk Appraisal (HRA) administered to employees of a large United States health care system across six locations. A total of 58 299 HRAs from 22 893 employees were completed and analyzed; 7959 employees completed the HRA each year for 4 years. The prevalence of 22 specific health conditions and their effects on productivity areas (quantity of work, quality of work, work not done, and concentration) were measured. The estimated daily productivity loss per person, annual cost per person, and annual company costs were calculated for each condition by fitting marginal models using generalized estimating equations. Intra-participant agreement in reported productivity loss across time was evaluated using κ statistics for each condition. The health conditions rated highest in prevalence were allergies and hypertension (high blood pressure). The conditions with the highest estimated daily productivity loss and annual cost per person were chronic back pain, mental illness, general anxiety, migraines or severe headaches, neck pain, and depression. Allergies and migraines or severe headaches had the highest estimated annual company cost. Most health conditions had at least fair intra-participant agreement (κ ≥ 0.40) on reported daily productivity loss. Results from the current study suggested a variety of health conditions contributed to daily productivity loss and resulted in additional annual estimated costs for the health care system. To improve the productivity and well-being of their workforce, employers should consider presenteeism data when planning comprehensive wellness initiatives to curb productivity loss and increase employee health and well-being during working hours.",Health administration; Health care; Productivity; Workplace wellness; Workforce; Presenteeism; Health services research; Indirect costs; Medicine; Environmental health,Depression; Employees; Headaches; Health; Health care system; Human resources; Mental illness; Presenteeism; Productivity loss; Workplace wellness,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cost of Illness; Costs and Cost Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care/economics; Depression/economics; Efficiency; Health Workforce/economics; Humans; Hypersensitivity/economics; Hypertension/economics; Mental Disorders/economics; Middle Aged; Migraine Disorders/economics; Occupational Health/economics; Pain/economics; Presenteeism/economics; Retrospective Studies; United States/epidemiology; Young Adult",10.1186/s12960-018-0321-9,true

Ensuring the best utilization of financial resources in the healthcare sector is important to provide unified and fair access to cancer care for all patients. Experts from the Qatar Oncology Health Economics Expert Panel (Q-OHEP) aimed to establish a consistent and robust base for evaluating oncology/hematology medications; involve patients' insights to accelerate access to cutting-edge medications; increase the value of cancer care; and reach a consensus for using cost-effective strategies and efficient methodologies in cancer treatment.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">The Q-OHEP convened on 30 November 2021 for a 3-hour meeting to discuss cancer management, therapeutics, and health economics in Qatar, focusing on four domains: (1) regulatory, (2) procurement, (3) treatment, and (4) patients. Discussions, guided by a moderator, focused on a list of suggested open-ended questions.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Some of the salient recommendations included the development of a formal, fast-track, preliminary approval pathway for drugs needed by patients with severe disease or in critical condition; and encouraging and promoting the conduct of local clinical trials and real-world observational studies using existing registry data.

Ncama,"Background ; Access to healthcare is an important public health concept and has been traditionally measured by using population level parameters, such as availability, distribution and proximity of the health facilities in relation to the population. However, client based factors such as their expectations, experiences and perceptions which impact their evaluations of health care access were not well studied and integrated into health policy frameworks and implementation programs.; Objective ; This study aimed to investigate factors associated with perceived access to HIV/AIDS Treatment and care services in Wolaita Zone, Ethiopia.; Methods ; A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 492 people living with HIV, with 411 using ART and 81 using pre-ART services accessed at six public sector health facilities from November 2014 to March 2015. Data were analyzed using the ologit function of STATA. The variables explored consisted of socio-demographic and health characteristics, type of health facility, type of care, distance, waiting time, healthcare responsiveness, transportation convenience, satisfaction with service, quality of care, financial fairness, out of pocket expenses and HIV disclosure.; Results ; Of the 492 participants, 294 (59.8%) were females and 198 (40.2%) were males, with a mean age of 38.8 years. 23.0% and 12.2% believed they had ‘good’ or ‘very good’ access respectively, and 64.8% indicated lower ratings. In the multivariate analysis, distance from the health facility, type of care, HIV clinical stage, out of pocket expenses, employment status, type of care, HIV disclosure and perceived transportation score were not associated with the perceived access (PA). With a unit increment in satisfaction, perceived quality of care, health system responsiveness, transportation convenience and perceived financial fairness scores, the odds of providing higher rating of PA increased by 29.0% (p<0.001), 6.0%(p<0.01), 100.0% (p<0.001), 9.0% (p<0.05) and 6.0% (p<0.05) respectively.; Conclusion ; Perceived quality of care, health system responsiveness, perceived financial fairness, transportation convenience and satisfaction with services were correlates of perceived access and affected healthcare performance.

The Cambodian health system has envisaged massive repositioning of various health care financing to ensure equitable access to health care. This analysis examines catastrophic, economic, as well as fairness, impacts of OOP health care payments on households in Cambodia over time. Methods: Data from two waves of a nationally representative household survey conducted in Cambodia (CDHS Surveys 2005 and 2010) were utilized. Healthcare utilizations based on economic status were compared during 2005 and 2010. Variables of interests were i) where care was sought and the instances of treatments, i.e. was treatment sought the first, second or third time; (ii) the mode of payment for treatment of the respondent or for any household member due to sickness or injury in the last 30 days prior to the survey period. Lorenz curves were applied to assess the degree of distribution of inequality in OOP expenditures between different income brackets. Results: The findings revealed that there was inequality and unfairness in health care payments, and catastrophic spending is more common among the poor in Cambodia. The majority of people from poorer households experienced economic hardship and have taken to catastrophic health care spending through sales of personal possessions.  Conclusion: Based on the findings from this analysis, more attention is needed on effective financial protection for Cambodians to promote fairness. The government should increase spending on services being provided at public health care facilities to reduce ever increasing reliance on private sector providers.

In order to improve transparency and communication to citizens, Italy recently updated the National Regulatory Plan for Waiting Lists (2019–2021), which calls for the disclosure of waiting time information on healthcare provider webpages. This study analyses waiting time information for outpatient visits and digital services available on the institutional website pages of 144 public healthcare organisations in nine regions and two autonomous provinces of Italy. Web pages were analysed both in terms of the available information/services, using a grid, and in terms of the quality of the text using an advanced readability assessment tool (READ-IT). This information was complemented and validated by regional healthcare key informants during research-specific workshops. Waiting time information disclosure, digital services and text readability varied both within and between the regional healthcare systems and organisations. The types and characteristics of waiting time information and statistics vary considerably with a negative impact on their use for benchmarking and their readability and usability for booking purposes.

Evidence from China.,2022,journal article,International journal of environmental research and public health,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Qian Xing; Wenxi Tang; Mingyang Li; Shuailong Li,"Volume-based drug purchasing by China's health insurance system currently represents the largest group purchasing organization worldwide. After exchanging the market that accounted for nearly half of the volume of the healthcare system for the ultra-low-price supply of limited drugs, what are the effects on patient and funding burdens, drug accessibility, and clinical efficacy? We aimed to verify the effectiveness of the policy, explore the reasons behind the problem and identify regulatory priorities and collaborative measures. We used literature and reported data from 2019 to 2021 to conduct a stakeholder analysis and health impact assessment, presenting the benefit and risk share for various dimensions. The analysis method was a multidimensional scaling model, which visualized problematic associations. Seventy-nine papers (61 publications and 18 other resources) were included in the study, with 22 effects and 36 problems identified. The results indicated favorable affordability and poor accessibility of drugs, as well as high risk of reduced drug quality and drug-use rationality. The drug-use demand of patients was guaranteed; the prescription rights of doctors regarding clinical drug use were limited; unreasonable evaluation indicators limited the transformation of public hospitals to value- and service-oriented organizations; the sustainability of health insurance funds and policy promotion were at risk; and innovation by pharmaceutical companies was accelerated. The problems associated with high co-occurrence frequencies were divided into the following clusters: cost control, drug accessibility, system rationality, policy fairness, drug quality, and moral hazards. These findings suggested that China has achieved short-term success in reducing the burden on patients and reducing fund expenditure.

Over 50% of complaints resulted in ‘no further action’ (national 60%; NSW 70%). The most common action was caution or counsel (national 12%; NSW 15%), followed by conditions, (national 10%; NSW 5%). Practitioner registration surrender was more common with the NSW than national system (national 0.1%; NSW 1.3%), but registration suspensions or cancellations were similar (national 0.6%; NSW 1.0%). Conclusion. The main difference between the two systems is the administrative decision as to how complaints are assessed. In NSW, a classification of a complaint as ‘performance’ usually means the complaint is not investigated; rather, the practitioner is assessed by peers and may be required to undergo further education and training. Reaching agreement and understanding of complaints that should be investigated and those appropriate for performance review would strengthen a national approach to health complaint regulation. What is known about the topic? The national system of managing healthcare complaints is relatively new (since 2010) compared with the NSW system (since 1993). Annual reports of the regulatory authorities provide summaries of types and outcomes of complaints separately for each profession, and separately for NSW and the national system, but we do not know how the two systems directly compare in terms of complaint management or their outcomes. What does this paper add? This study examined how different types of complaints are managed between the two systems and whether there are any differences in outcomes. The types of complaints are almost identical between the two systems, but classification of complaints as ‘performance’ or ‘conduct’ differed. Immediate action is more common in the national than NSW system, especially for health impairment and boundary crossing. Health impairment complaints are much less likely to be discontinued at the assessment stage in NSW compared with the national system. The NSW and national systems are similar in terms of complaints proceeding to either an investigation or performance or health assessment, but the national system investigates more than the NSW system. For many types of complaints the outcomes were similar between systems, but there were clear differences for some types of complaints, such as health impairment and boundary crossing. What are the implications for practitioners? An efficient and fair regulatory system is crucial for maintaining practitioner trust, as well as trust of the public. This study shows that there are many similarities between the national and NSW systems in terms of process and outcomes, but there are differences in the way some types of complaints are assessed between the two systems. This knowledge may assist regulatory authorities in their efforts to achieve a nationally consistent approach to complaints.",Pharmacy; Public health; Government; Health care; Health assessment; Population health; Complaint; Family medicine; Health economics; Medicine,,"Australia; Health Personnel/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Medical Errors/statistics & numerical data; New South Wales; Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care; Patient Satisfaction; Retrospective Studies",10.1071/ah18262,false

It is one of the most determinant factors for an effective utilization of human resources and an essential predictor of organizational success (J Manag Dev 28:457-477, 2009). Employees who perceive fairness are more likely happy with their job and less likely leave their organization (Int J Bus Manage 4:145-154, 2009). Perceived injustice, on the other hand, diminishes motivation of workers to accomplish their duties (Int J Bus Manage 4:145-154, 2009; J Educ Sci Univ Tabriz 2:27-34, 2009). Ethiopia has given emphasis to the expansion of health institutions and increasing the number of health professionals. Despite this, little emphasis has been given the human resource aspect of the health sector. Therefore, this study aims to investigate organizational justice perceptions and turnover intentions among healthcare workers in Amhara region. One hundred ninety seven healthcare workers participated in the study. Data were collected through self- report questionnaire and semi-structured interview. The quantitative data were analyzed through MANOVA, multiple regression, and independent samples t-test. The qualitative data were analyzed through thematic analysis. The results of this study revealed that healthcare workers in the public hospitals held low perceived distributive, procedural, interpersonal and informational justice. Similarly, private hospitals healthcare workers had low perceptions on distributive and procedural justice. On the contrary, healthcare workers in private hospitals reported high perception of fairness on interpersonal and informational justice aspects. Both public and private hospital healthcare workers had high turnover intention. The result revealed significant difference in organizational justice perceptions between private and public hospital healthcare workers (F (4, 182) = 9.17; p < .05; partial η2 =. 168). Organizational justice dimensions (distributive, procedural, interpersonal and informational justice) significantly contributed an additional 9.9% variation in turnover intention (R 2 change = .099, F (4,170) = 4.86, p < .05). Distributive justice was the most important predictor of turnover intention (β = −.23, p < .05). Organizational justice perceptions of healthcare workers significantly predicted turnover intention. Hence, organizational justice should be given due emphasis in designing and implementing policies and strategies of human resource management.",Psychology; Health care; Human resource management; Public hospital; Justice (ethics); Procedural justice; Organizational justice; Distributive justice; Thematic analysis; Social psychology,And turnover intention; Healthcare workers; Organizational justice,Adult; Ethiopia; Female; Health Personnel/psychology; Humans; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Organizational Culture; Personnel Turnover; Social Justice; Surveys and Questionnaires,10.1186/s40359-020-0387-8,true

Post-hoc explainability methods where a simple, human-interpretable model imitates the behavior of these blackbox models are often proposed to help users trust model predictions. In this work, we audit the quality of such explanations for different protected subgroups using real data from four settings in finance, healthcare, college admissions, and the US justice system. Across two different blackbox model architectures and four popular explainability methods, we find that the approximation quality of explanation models, also known as the fidelity, differs significantly between subgroups. We also demonstrate that pairing explainability methods with recent advances in robust machine learning can improve explanation fairness in some settings. However, we highlight the importance of communicating details of non-zero fidelity gaps to users, since a single solution might not exist across all settings. Finally, we discuss the implications of unfair explanation models as a challenging and understudied problem facing the machine learning community.",Computer science; Fidelity; Audit; Quality (philosophy); Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; High fidelity; Data science; Telecommunications; Philosophy; Epistemology; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Management; Economics,,,10.1145/3531146.3533179,true

Rice; Kathy Eljiz; Anneke Fitzgerald; Rod Peter Gapp; Andrea Marshall,"Objective This study examines the relationships between job satisfaction and organisational justice during a time of transformational change. Methods Data collection occurred immediately before a major regional hospital's move to a greenfield site. Existing measures of job satisfaction and organisational justice were used. Data were analysed (n=316) using descriptive, correlation and regression methods together with interactions between predictor variables. Results Correlation coefficients for satisfaction and organisational justice variables were high and significant at the P<0.001 level. Results of a robust regression model (adjusted R(2)=0.568) showed all three components of organisational justice contributed significantly to employee job satisfaction. Interactions between the predictor variables showed that job satisfaction increased as the interactions between the predictor variables increased. Conclusions The finding that even at a time of transformational change staff perceptions of fair treatment will in the main result in high job satisfaction extends the literature in this area. In addition, it was found that increasing rewards for staff who perceive low levels of organisational justice does not increase satisfaction as much as for staff who perceive high levels of fairness. If people feel negative about their role, but feel they are well paid, they probably still have negative feelings overall. What is known about the topic? Despite much research highlighting the importance of job satisfaction and organisational justice in healthcare, no research has examined the influence of transformational change, such as a healthcare organisational relocation, on these factors. What does this paper add? The research adds to academic literature relating to job satisfaction and organisational justice. It highlights the importance of organisational justice in influencing the job satisfaction of staff. What are the implications for practitioners?

Lix; Jacqueline Quail; Xiaoyun Eric Wang; Meric Osman; Gary F. Teare,"A patient’s trajectory through the healthcare system affects resource use and outcomes. Data fields in population-based administrative health databases are potentially valuable resources for constructing care trajectories for entire populations, provided they can capture patient transitions between healthcare services. This study describes patient transitions from the emergency department (ED) to other healthcare settings, and ascertains whether the discharge disposition field recorded in the ED data was a reliable source of patient transition information from the emergency to the acute care settings. Administrative health databases from the province of Saskatchewan, Canada (population 1.1 million) were used to identify patients with at least one ED visit to provincial teaching hospitals (n = 5) between April 1, 2006 and March 31, 2012. Discharge disposition from ED was described using frequencies and percentages; and it includes categories such as home, transfer to other facilities, and died. The kappa statistic with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) was used to measure agreement between the discharge disposition field in the ED data and hospital admission records. We identified N = 1,062,861 visits for 371,480 patients to EDs over the six-year study period. Three-quarters of the discharges were to home, 16.1 % were to acute care in the same facility in which the ED was located, and 1.6 % resulted in a patient transfer to a different acute care facility. Agreement between the discharge disposition field in the ED data and hospital admission records was good when the emergency and acute care departments were in the same facility (κ = 0.77, 95 % CI 0.77, 0.77). For transfers to a different acute care facility, agreement was only fair (κ = 0.36, 95 % CI 0.35, 0.36). The majority of patients who attended EDs did not transition to another healthcare setting. For those who transitioned to acute care, accuracy of the discharge disposition field depended on whether the two services were provided in the same facility. Using the hospital data as reference, we conclude that the discharge disposition field in the ED data is not reliable for measuring transitions from ED to acute care.",Health administration; Health informatics; Health care; Emergency medicine; Emergency department; Acute care; Population; Patient transfer; Nursing research; Medical emergency; Medicine; Database,Agreement; Data linkage; Emergency department; Healthcare trajectory; Hospital records,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Databases, Factual; Emergency Medical Services/statistics & numerical data; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Hospital Records; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Transfer/statistics & numerical data; Retrospective Studies; Saskatchewan",10.1186/s12913-016-1775-x,true
052-998-768-220-018,Life Course Investments at the Maternal and Child Health Bureau.,2022,journal article,Pediatrics,American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP),United States,Dana M Foney; Jessica DiBari; Rui Li; Michael Kogan,"The Life Course Health Development (LCHD) framework posits that an individual’s health is the result of dynamic and continuous interactions among biological, social, environmental, and behavioral risk and protective factors throughout their lifetime.1 The early years represent a time of particular sensitivity to various genetic and environmental contributing factors2 and David Barker’s pioneering work on the connections between birth weight and health later in life shows that there is a considerable “front-loading” of the way in which events and experiences influence life-long health. The LCHD framework also emphasizes the importance of multiple levels and conditions of the surrounding environment on maternal and child health (MCH), including health care access and quality, along with a range of other factors that, all together, broadly constitute the social determinants of health.3 Consequently, there is a need for broad and diverse approaches to adopting life course interventions in MCH research, with thoughtful consideration of the type, level, and mode of delivery of those interventions, their timing, and the plan to study their efficacy and effectiveness. The current challenge is how to advance life course research through rigorously testing hypotheses with longitudinal data when available, and through innovative approaches to shorter-term studies and analysis of cross-sectional data when it is not. By considering the health and well-being of the whole person in the context of the family and ecosystem, and identifying strategic points and ways to intervene, life course intervention research aims to have a greater collective impact on MCH, and to accelerate the translation of life course theory to practice.The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) within the Health Resources and Services Administration of the US Department of Health and Human Services supports health care and public health services for an estimated 60 million people nationwide. Its mission is to give children and families a fair shot at reaching their full potential by creating opportunities that foster optimal health and allow them to live long, healthy lives regardless of their income, education, or racial or ethnic background. Prevention and early intervention are critical to this mission. MCHB has made a long-term investment into the LCHD approach and its application to practice through the administration of programs, support of research, and investment in training of the next generation of researchers from a life course perspective.4 MCHB has a deliberate focus on, and support for, advancing equity within MCH life course research and supports the study of social determinants of health and health equity, which reflect part of the life course framework on the interactions among biological, social, environmental, and behavioral risk and protective factors.MCHB first supported the Life Course Research Network beginning in 2010, which allowed groups across the nation to continue to develop the LCHD Model5 and its application to research, policy, and practice. This led to the publication of several articles,6 the creation of an initial MCH life course research agenda, and the Handbook of LCHD7 which has informed teaching, research development, and healthcare practice both in the United States and abroad. There has been sustained interest in research to better understand life course influences on health and to identify the best ways to translate this knowledge into practice to benefit the health of mothers and children.MCHB has expanded the scope of the investment on life course research to provide funding for the Life Course Intervention Research Network (LCI-RN) beginning in 2018 for a 5-year project period. This support allows the LCI-RN to build an infrastructure for researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and stakeholders to promote the development, translation, implementation, and dissemination of the Life Course Intervention Research Agenda; the latter will serve as a roadmap by identifying short-term and long-term research priorities. The LCI-RN also serves as a mechanism for interacting, sharing information, and engaging in collaborative and innovative projects and multisite life course intervention research studies that advance LCHD research and inform evidence-based practice and policymaking.The LCI-RN consists of a national coordinating center; two research cores that focus on cross cutting themes in life course research: family and community engagement and race, place, class and gender; and 9 research nodes, each of which focuses on a priority topic for children’s health development: adversity, adaptation and resilience; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; early childhood mental health; family health development; family measurement; schools; juvenile justice; prematurity; and youth participatory engagement. These nodes encompass the ecosystem in which children live, develop, learn, and grow within the context of the broad LCHD framework. Each node creatively designs new types of interventions to improve health over the life course. Most recently, LCI-RN focused attention to the direct physical effects, as well as the acute and long-term threats to the health and well-being of children resulting from society’s response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A greater understanding of the pathways operating across the life course that might make 1 person more vulnerable than another to the effects of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, has consequently emerged as a research priority; thus, the life course framework guides part of the research agenda and practice for COVID-19.MCHB continues to support new and innovative approaches to advance life-course research; facilitate new partnerships and new interventions that apply the life course framework to inform emerging issues; test and iterate the framework in new settings; and provide the highest possible quality of services and equitable interventions for families and children, improving their health, through infancy into adulthood. The LCI-RN is one of a group of MCHB-funded research programs that focuses on the development of MCH from a life course perspective.8 For example: Autism Longitudinal Data Project supports research that improves understanding of early life origins, signs, and indicators of autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities to maximize health outcomes and trajectories of child development over the life course.Autism Transitions Research Project advances the evidence base on the social determinants and risk factors associated with healthy life (physical, social, mental health, and educational or occupational) outcomes among adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder who are transitioning to adulthood.Autism Intervention Research Network on Physical Health has established a research network to enhance the physical health, well-being, and quality of life for autistic individuals, with a focus on underserved and vulnerable populations, and supporting them across the lifespan.Adolescent and Young Adult Health Research Network focuses on the developmental window of ages 10 to 24 years to study the complex interaction of biopsychosocial factors that shape health trajectories of adolescents, which could influence their health in adulthood.Home Visiting Applied Research Collaborative is a research network that conducts innovative home visiting research as part of the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, one of the largest MCHB investments, to improve prenatal and early life experiences which lay the foundation for health and development across the lifespan.The papers in this supplement are intended to drive and enhance the field of life course intervention research and pose challenging questions that could be best addressed by using a life course framework to advance the MCH field. For example, the LCHD model recognizes the major importance of families as the creators of the intimate ecosystem in which children develop and grow, and the way in which families function and family health develops over time and opportunities to intervene to improve it. Schools are also an important ecosystem that are critical to children’s educational, cognitive, social and health development trajectories. The contribution of families and schools has not been fully appreciated in existing models. More research is needed to explore the impact of families and schools on each child’s growth and development. The promise of Life Course interventions will only be realized through interdisciplinary collaborations that create new types of partnerships which must always include families and communities. MCHB commends each thoughtful researcher and contributor for collaborating on this supplement to share innovative approaches and for serving as thought leaders in the field.",Medicine; Life course approach; Course (navigation); Environmental health; Gerontology; Family medicine; Medical education; Developmental psychology; Psychology; Physics; Astronomy,,Child; Child Health; Family; Humans; Investments; Life Change Events,10.1542/peds.2021-053509b,false

Freire's theory of oppression has been used as an underpinning theory for developing the conceptual framework. This study empirically verifies the conceptual framework of the study that gender discrimination and lack of administrative support are the antecedents of person-related hostility, which is the reason for poor job performance in the healthcare sector. We applied a quantitative research approach, using questionnaires to collect data. Total of 707 survey forms were collected from female nurses working in public sector hospitals in four main cities of Pakistan. The software SPSS 20 and SmartPLS 3 were used for the final data analysis. All hypotheses regarding the direct and indirect relationship of variables were accepted. Gender discrimination and lack of administrative support were positively associated with person-related hostility. Moreover, person-related hostility also mediated the relationship between independent variables (gender discrimination, lack of administrative support) and dependent variable (poor job performance). Future research is directed to study person-related hostility among nursing staff of semi-urban areas and small towns with low literacy rates, considering other dependent variables like burnout, mental well-being, and mental health.

055-520-911-102-476,A Qualitative Exploration to Understand Access to Pharmacy Medication Reviews: Views from Marginalized Patient Groups,2020,journal article,"Pharmacy (Basel, Switzerland)",,Switzerland,Asam Latif; Baguiasri Mandane; Abid Ali; Sabina Ghumra; Nargis Gulzar,"Background: Vulnerable patients from marginalized groups (e.g., people with disabilities, people experiencing homelessness, black and minority ethnic communities) experience higher rates of ill-health, inequitable access to healthcare and low engagement with screening services. Addressing these disparities and ensuring healthcare provision is impartial and fair is a priority for the United Kingdom (UK) healthcare system. Aim: Using Levesque’s access conceptual framework, this study explored the views of patients from marginalized groups, specifically on how access to pharmacy services could be improved and their experiences of receiving a medication review service. Method: Qualitative data were collected via semi-structured interviews on patient experiences of pharmacy services and how access to these could be improved (n = 10). Interviews of patients who had received a medication review from their pharmacist were also conducted (n = 10). Using an interpretivist approach, five ‘demand-side’ dimensions of Levesque’s access conceptual framework were explored (ability to perceive a need for medication support, their ability to seek this support, ability to reach the pharmacy, ability to pay and engage). Results: The findings exposed the medicine, health and social care challenges of vulnerable people and how these are often not being adequately managed or met. Using the access formwork, we unpack and demonstrate the significant challenges patients face accessing pharmacy support. Discussion: Pharmacy organizations need to pay attention to how patients perceive the need for pharmacy support and their ability to seek, reach and engage with this. Further training may be needed for community pharmacy staff to ensure services are made accessible, inclusive and culturally sensitive. Effective engagement strategies are needed to enable the provision of a flexible and adaptable service that delivers patient-centred care. Policy makers should seek to find ways to reconfigure services to ensure people from diverse backgrounds can access such services.",Pharmacy; Ethnic group; Conceptual framework; Psychology; Nursing; Health care; Health equity; Pharmacist; Service (business); Qualitative property,access; digital learning intervention; health inequity; marginalized patients,,10.3390/pharmacy8020073,true

We integrate fairness theory and band extension theory to develop a research model. This is further tested by structural equation modeling (SEM), with 279 valid sets of data from patients on the online health platform. Using partial least squares analysis (PLS), the results show that perceived fairness is an important factor affecting online satisfaction and the willingness to ask online doctors, which in turn has a positive impact on the willingness to go to offline doctors.

Birkelien,"INTRODUCTIONHospitals face a continuing challenge to reduce the gap between consumers' expectations and the actual services provided. Since the 1990s, hospitals have recognized that customer service and provider-patient interactions are important in creating successful outcomes, and they have emphasized the measurement and reporting of patient satisfaction measures (Fottler, Ford, & Heaton, 2002). As a consequence of intensifying market pressures, pay-for-performance tied to HcAHps (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare providers and systems) survey scores, and greater consumer expectations, hospitals are focusing on maximizing the patientexperience.To establish and maintain a competitive advantage, hospitals must acknowledge and prioritize patient experience as a key to organizational success and sustainability. Although healthcare leaders recognize the value and growing implications of the patient experience, hospitals struggle with consistency in addressing the patient experience. Misunderstanding of consumer expectations and inconsistent organizational practices leave room for improvement. By identifying the dimensions of patient experience valued by the customer, hospitals can tailor services according to customer expectations.Improving the patient experience should be fundamental to the mission and goals of any healthcare organization, because it will result in high return on investment, quality improvements, and increased customer loyalty (Betts, Balan-Cohen, Shukla, & Kumar, 2016; Charmel & Frampton, 2008). Although HCAHPS scores are important to meeting short-term goals, a hospital that strives for long-term success and market leadership must implement patient experience initiatives that go beyond HCAHPS. Hospitals have a duty to seek more than financial gains; they must operate a people-centered organization that promotes ""purpose, worthwhile work, and making a difference"" in the lives of patients (Studer, 2003, p. 4).Hospitals will fulfill their duty to patients if they establish a culture that supports the patient experience, facilitates patient-provider communication, improves information transparency, increases patient engagement, makes the organization accessible to consumers, creates an empathetic environment, and prioritizes quality clinical outcomes. The purpose of this essay is to provide a strategic framework for hospital administrators to maximize the patient experience by focusing on satisfying patients' wants and needs.BACKGROUNDIn the 1990s, hospitals began using patient satisfaction surveys to identify their strengths and weaknesses (Fottler et al., 2002). Hospitals have learned that patient expectations have an important influence on patient satisfaction. In 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) mandated that U.S. hospitals gather data on patient satisfaction by distributing the HCAHPS survey. This standardized survey has provided hospitals with a baseline comparative model by which to measure patient-assessed hospital performance. Because reimbursement rates are now tied to HCAHPS scores through the value-based purchasing initiative, hospitals are now motivated by more than competitive market pressures (Ferrari, 2012). The HCAHPS requirement reflects a systematic focus on quality outcomes that highlights the patient experience as a key quality measure for healthcare organizations.The HCAHPS generates publicly available data that allow fair comparisons between hospitals, incentivize hospitals to improve quality, and hold hospitals accountable for services paid for by public funds (Long, 2012). HCAHPS survey items fall into eight experience-of-care categories: communication with physicians, communication with nurses, pain management, cleanliness and quietness of the hospital environment, responsiveness of hospital staff, communication about medications, discharge information, and overall rating ofthe hospital (CMS, 2016). …",Business; Loyalty business model; Nursing; Health care; Patient satisfaction; Medicaid; Patient experience; Quality (business); Value-Based Purchasing; Competitive advantage,,Hospitals; Humans; Patient Satisfaction; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; Value-Based Purchasing,10.1097/jhm-d-17-00071,false

Schorr; Krystal Hunter; Patti Rager Zuzelo,"BACKGROUND Quality improvement efforts in sepsis management have increased patients' survival rates. Many sepsis survivors experience sequelae leading to unplanned hospital readmissions and subsequent mortality, especially when survivors delay seeking medical attention because they do not recognize the signs and symptoms of recurrent sepsis. Thus, increasing knowledge of sepsis among patients and caregivers before initial hospital discharge is essential. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the understandability and actionability of a printable patient education tool on sepsis. METHODS Ten sepsis experts were invited to evaluate and score the content of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sepsis Fact Sheet for understandability and actionability using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for printable material. Data were collected on 24 items via an electronic survey. Descriptive analysis included overall and understandability and actionability scores and measurement of interrater reliability. Items with discrepancies were reviewed. RESULTS Nine experts responded to the survey. Mean understandability (80.74), actionability (90.74), and overall (83.33) scores support the tool's utility for patient education. Interrater reliability found fair-to-moderate agreement across survey items. CONCLUSIONS The Sepsis Fact Sheet provides useful patient information as evaluated using established recommendations for printed materials and expert content validation. Areas for improvement include providing a summary, modifying images, and simplifying language.

STUDY DESIGN A literature review was undertaken to identify candidate adjustment variables. The candidate variables were revised by clinical experts to confirm their clinical relevance to SSI; experts also offered additional candidate variables that were not identified in the literature review. Two risk-adjustment models were developed using multiple logistic regression thus allowing calculation of the adjusted indicator rates. DATA SOURCE The two SSI indicators, with their corresponding risk-adjustment models, were calculated from administrative databases obtained from nine public hospitals. A dataset was obtained from a 10-year period (2006-2015), and it included data from 21 571 clean surgery patients and 6325 colorectal surgery patients. ANALYSIS METHODS Risk-adjustment regression models were constructed using Spanish National Health System data. Models were analysed so as to prevent overfitting, then tested for calibration and discrimination and finally bootstrapped. RESULTS Ten adjustment variables were identified for clean surgery SSI, and 23 for colorectal surgery SSI. The final adjustment models showed fair calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow: clean surgery χ2 = 6.56, P = 0.58; colorectal surgery χ2 = 6.69, P = 0.57) and discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve: clean surgery 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.77; colorectal surgery 0.62, 95% CI 0.60-0.65).

Therefore, the global world starts to look for unconventional approaches and technologies to combat the dissemination of the COVID-19 virus, for example, utilizing Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. Using robotics for medical services is facing many challenges that may lead to failure. The most important of these challenges is that the healthcare workers are not trained well on using robotics, don’t have enough knowledge, awareness of the importance of using robotics especially during pandemics, and the relatively high cost of robotics. Thus, in this paper, we assess the levels of knowledge, attitude, and practices of healthcare workers about using robotics during pandemics. Further, a quantitative and a qualitative approach using a questionnaire to collect data is used. Over 40 healthcare workers participate, who have a fair background about robots.

More recently, the fair distribution of healthcare resources among population subgroups have become an important indication of health inequities. Single disease outcomes are commonly used for healthcare resource allocations; however, leveraging population-level comorbidity measures for health disparity research has been limited. This study compares the geographical distribution of comorbidity and associated healthcare utilization among commercially insured individuals in South Africa (SA) relative to the distribution of physicians.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis was performed comparing the geographical distribution of comorbidity and physicians for 2.6 million commercially insured individuals over 2016-2017, stratified by geographical districts and population groups in SA. We applied the Johns Hopkins ACG® System across the claims data of a large health plan administrator to measure a comorbidity risk score for each individual. By aggregating individual scores, we determined the average healthcare resource need of individuals per district, known as the comorbidity index (CMI), to describe the disease burden per district. Linear regression models were constructed to test the relationship between CMI, age, gender, population group, and population density against physician density.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Our results showed a tendency for physicians to practice in geographic areas with more insurance enrollees and not necessarily where disease burden may be highest. This was confirmed by a negative relationship between physician density and CMI for the overall population and for three of the four major population groups. Among the population groups, the Black African population had, on average, access to fewer physicians per capita than other population groups, before and after adjusting for confounding factors.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">CMI is a novel measure for healthcare disparities research that considers both acute and chronic conditions contributing to current and future healthcare costs. Our study linked and compared the population-level geographical distribution of CMI to the distribution of physicians using routinely collected data. Our results could provide vital information towards the more equitable distribution of healthcare providers across population groups in SA, and to meet the healthcare needs of disadvantaged communities.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2022.

Despite plentiful evidence characterizing the impact of drug shortages, there is a remarkable dearth of data describing current shortage management practices. Hospitals within the same state or region may not only take different approaches to shortages but may be unaware of shortages proximate facilities are facing. Our goal is to explore how hospitals in Michigan handle drug shortages to assess potential need for comprehensive drug shortage management resources. We conducted semi-structured interviews with diverse stakeholders throughout the state to describe experiences managing drug shortages, approaches to recent shortages, openness to inter-institutional engagement, ideas for a shared resource, and potential obstacles to implementation. To solicit additional feedback on ideas for a shared resource gathered from the interviews, we held focus groups with pharmacists, physicians, ethicists, and community representatives. Among participants representing a heterogeneous sample of institutions, three themes were consistent: (1) numerous drug shortage strategies occurring simultaneously; (2) inadequate resources and lead time to proactively manage shortages; and (3) interest in, but varied attitudes toward, a collaborative approach. These data provide insight to help develop and test a shared drug shortage management resource for enhancing fair allocation of scarce drugs.

Methods The study was conducted on 140 self-identified LGBT individuals in Turkey between 11 April and 15 July 2016 as a descriptive, electronical survey design. Data were collected by questionnaire form, developed based on the researchers' review of the literature. Results The results of this study revealed that 65% of LGBT participants self-reported that their mental health status was 'poor/fair' while 69% of participants reported that their physical health was 'good/excellent'. Most of them had smoking (60%), using alcohol (76.3%) and did unprotected sex (55.3%) and reported disclosing their LGBT status to the healthcare provider (90.6%); 48.6% of participants thought that disclosing their LGBT status would affect their treatment. Barriers to healthcare access included disclosing LGBT status, societal stigma, negative attitude of healthcare provider, dissatisfaction with healthcare, and lack of health insurance and financial resources. Conclusions These results can assist healthcare providers, especially nurses as critical members of this group, to serve LGBT individuals satisfactorily. Besides, it is expected that these results will shed light on new research.",Mental health; Psychology; Health care; Stigma (botany); Health equity; Sexual minority; Transgender; Lesbian; Affect (psychology); Family medicine,LGBT health; nursing; vulnerable groups,Adolescent; Adult; Female; Health Behavior; Health Services Accessibility; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Turkey; Young Adult,10.1111/scs.12759,false

Wardle; Amie Steel; Jon Adams,"We examined the magnitude and correlates of Ebola virus disease (EVD)-related stigma among EVD survivors in Sierra Leone since their return to their communities. In addition, we determined whether EVD-related stigma is a predictor of informal health care use among EVD survivors. We conducted a cross-sectional study among 358 EVD survivors in five districts across all four geographic regions (Western Area, Northern Province, Eastern Province and Southern Province) of Sierra Leone. Ebola-related stigma was measured by adapting the validated HIV related stigma for people living with HIV/AIDS instrument. We also measured traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) use (as a measure of informal healthcare use). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. EVD survivors report higher levels of internalised stigma (0.92 ± 0.77) compared to total enacted stigma (0.71 ± 0.61). Social isolation (0.96 ± 0.88) was the highest reported enacted stigma subscale. Ebola survivors who identified as Christians [AOR = 2.51, 95%CI: 1.15–5.49, p = 0.021], who perceived their health to be fair/poor [AOR = 2.58, 95%CI: 1.39–4.77. p = 0.003] and who reside in the northern region of Sierra Leone [AOR = 2.80, 95%CI: 1.29–6.07, p = 0.009] were more likely to experience internalised stigma. Verbal abuse [AOR = 1.95, 95%CI: 1.09–3.49, p = 0.025] and healthcare neglect [AOR = 2.35, 95%CI: 1.37–4.02, p = 0.002] were independent predictors of T&CM use among EVD survivors. Our findings suggest EVD-related stigma (internalised and enacted) is prevalent among EVD survivors since their return to their communities. Religiosity, perceived health status and region were identified as independent predictors of internalised stigma. Verbal abuse and healthcare neglect predict informal healthcare use. EVD survivor-centred and community-driven anti-stigma programs are needed to promote EVD survivors’ recovery and community re-integration.",Public health; Demography; Health care; Stigma (botany); Neglect; Social isolation; Verbal abuse; Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); Sierra leone; Medicine,Ebola; Ebola survivor; Informal health care; Sierra Leone; Stigma; Traditional medicine,"Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola/psychology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics & numerical data; Sierra Leone; Social Stigma; Survivors/psychology; Young Adult",10.1186/s12889-020-8279-7,true

The purpose of this strategy report is to describe the methods of determining national strategic AI priorities and set these priorities. In this report, according to the patent applications between 1980 and 2016, it is stated that the fields in which AI technologies are applied the most are: communication (24%), transportation (24%), and health sciences (19%). Therefore, it is seen that almost 1/5 of all AI technologies are applied in the field of health science. It can be concluded that AI technologies used in the field of health have a special place in the scope of the TNAIS report. The report covers four ethical values including: respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law, improving the environment and biological ecosystem, ensuring diversity and inclusion, and living in peaceful, just and cohesive societies; and eight ethical principles including (1) proportionality, (2) safety and security, (3) fairness, (4) privacy, (5) transparency and explainability, (6) responsibility and accountability, (7) data sovereignty, and (8) multi-stakeholder governance. Consequently, in this study, the TNAIS report will be analyzed based on the ethical values and principles it contains within the scope of patients&apos; access to healthcare. Then the current or prospective ethical issues emerging from the existence of AI technology used in healthcare will be addressed. Finally, the suggestions about the perspectives for approaching ethical issues when these values and principles are in conflict will be shared.",Transparency (behavior); Accountability; Scope (computer science); Health care; Political science; Engineering ethics; Public relations; Sociology; Law; Engineering; Computer science; Programming language,,,10.5339/connect.2022.medhumconf.31,true

OBJECTIVE Assessing the validity of the system, compared to the psychologists' judgment. METHODS Concurrent validity, using routinely collected data of 675 primary care patients with a suspicion of a mental disorder in the Netherlands. Four psychologists classified the patients according to the DSM-IV. Hundred records were randomly selected to investigate the inter-rater reliability among psychologists. To investigate the concurrent validity of the system the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs), negative predictive values (NPVs) and Cohen's κ-values (κ-values) were calculated. RESULTS Inter-rater agreement between psychologists were fair to good or excellent. The system could correctly estimate the echelon (sensitivity range: 0.85-0.95, specificity range: 0.88-0.98) and correctly identify most Axis I classifications (sensitivity: 0.46-1.00, specificity: 0.75-0.99), except for Asperger's, sexual and adjustment disorders (sensitivity: 0.10-0.24, specificity: 0.97-0.99). It could determine the absence of a personality disorder (sensitivity: 0.81, specificity: 0.84, PPV: 0.77, NPV: 0.87 and κ-value: 0.65). The sensitivities and specificities for most specific personality disorders were good, but the PPVs for several specific Axis II classifications were low (PPV range: 0.06-0.77). The system was inaccurate in identifying the global assessment of functioning of patients (e.g. κ-values varied from 0.17-0.46). CONCLUSIONS Generally, the system can be seen as a valid instrument for most DSM-IV classifications in primary care patients. It could assist healthcare professionals in the assessment and classification of mental disorders.

Patients who apply for a permanent place in a nursing home are among society's most vulnerable. Hence, it is of great importance that the process of nursing home placement is just. The purpose of this study was to explore which criteria and values allocation of nursing home placements are built on, and whether the process is just. METHODS The study has a qualitative design. Data were collected through individual interviews and observation. Executive officers in different municipalities who have the formal responsibility for the placements, and GPs and nurses on short-term wards in nursing homes were interviewed. In addition, one of the researchers observed meetings where allocation of municipal healthcare services was discussed. RESULTS Healthcare personnel in primary health care mainly agree on which criteria are the most important in order to safeguard the principle of justice. However, some unintended and less highlighted factors could jeopardise the ideal of fair and just allocation. Some of these were organizational variations, variations in the municipalities' economy, variations in individual judgments and resourceful and strong-willed relatives. CONCLUSIONS Our study indicates that some of the weakest and most vulnerable patients in the Norwegian society are not treated equally. In order to safeguard the principle of justice, specific national criteria should be used in allocation of nursing home placements. However, national criteria are not enough. We suggest that in addition to guiding criteria, the unintended factors should be given more attention and focus on how to control them in a better way.",Welfare state; Socioeconomic status; Psychology; Nursing; Health care; Control (management); Community health; Justice (ethics); Resource allocation; Norwegian,community health; justice; nursing home assignment; priority setting; resource allocation,Health Resources; Hospitals; Humans; Norway; Nursing Homes,10.1111/scs.12792,true

According to WHO, on March 26, 2021, SARS- CoV-2 virus has infected a total of 125 million people worldwide and caused 3 million casualties. There have been 14.5 million confirmed cases in Southeast Asia, out of which 6.5 lac confirmed cases of COVID-19 are from Pakistan alone, with 14,028 deaths. In Sindh, Pakistan, there have been 2.6 lac confirmed cases of COVID-19 out of which 2 lac 56 thousand have recovered while 4,487 died. Since the outbreak, countless research has been undertaken pertaining to the virus transmission cycle and different countries have strived to come up with a vaccine to protect the masses. The continued dissemination of this coronavirus vaccine emphasizes the role of international collaboration in the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Factors contributing towards vaccine hesitancy include unknown adverse effects of the vaccine, perceived threats, lack of awareness, religious beliefs, myths surrounding the pandemic and vaccine, lack of confidence in the health system and lack of community awareness about vaccine-preventable diseases. Moreover, since the vaccine is new and there is a lack of research pertaining to its efficacy and detrimental effects, people are reluctant to get vaccinated. The findings of this study might help the government figure out the best way to introduce mass vaccination programs in Pakistan and other South Asian countries. Moreover, lockdowns and social distancing may be eased if a COVID-19 vaccination offers immune defense, which will be beneficial for the country’s economy.  Objective: To gauge the percentage of citizens who are willing to become vaccinated, their overall attitude towards the vaccination programs and the factors contributing towards vaccine hesitancy at the COVID Vaccination Center, Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Center, Karachi, Pakistan.  Methodology: A cross sectional study from May 2021 to August 2021 was conducted at the COVID Vaccination Center, Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Center in Karachi. The study was conducted on 400 persons who were either the vaccination staff of the COVID Vacination Center or the persons coming for COVID vaccination. The sampling technique was non probability purposive sampling. The data was collected by rotating a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was given to the data collectors who distributed them to the vaccination staff and the visitors .Written consent was taken from the participants and all ethical considerations and research protocols were observed. Data was collected in the form of pre-tested self-administered questionnaires. In order to standardize the questionnaires, a pilot study was conducted among research participants for the purpose of examining content validity. Data collected was analyzed using SPSS software version 20. The statistical analysis was conducted with 95% confidence interval and a p-value of &lt;0.05 was taken as threshold of statistical significance.

These one-time, potentially curative treatments pose a challenge in the US healthcare model, where high prices and insurance coverage variation may prevent patients from receiving life-altering therapies. Questioning of high prices occurs when patients, payers, and policy makers hold divergent views on the value and uncertainty of therapies. The key for patients is that high prices need to be justified, and companies need to partner authentically with patients. Companies should not automatically assume that the combination of the “gene therapy” label and a small patient population justifies high prices. To speed up the development process and potentially reduce costs, patients want the industry to improve clinical trial efficiency by sharing data, including natural history studies and failed trial results. From the patient perspective, current value assessment frameworks disadvantage people with disabilities, may not accurately reflect patients’ and societal views, and omit necessary factors such as impact on caregivers, lost productivity, and the future value of innovation. Value determination methods need to provide fair incentives and outcomes to industry, payers, regulators, and especially patients—the courageous pioneers who need equitable and sustainable access to life-changing gene-based therapies.",Health care; Actuarial science; Future value; Perspective (graphical); Productivity; Value (ethics); Disadvantage; Incentive; Clinical trial; Biology,,Caregivers; Costs and Cost Analysis; Drug Costs; Genetic Therapy; Humans; Rare Diseases/therapy,10.1038/s41434-019-0110-7,false

Increased testing could reduce this disparity. It is critical to understand subgroups of U.S. Vietnamese least likely to have been tested for Hepatitis B and design appropriate interventions. We examined healthcare- and acculturation-related factors influencing Hepatitis B testing among U.S. Vietnamese. Survey data of 100 U.S. Vietnamese attending health fairs/programs hosted by community-based organizations (2017–2018) were analyzed. Healthcare-related predictors included insurance and past 2-year checkup. Acculturation-related predictors included Vancouver Acculturation Index, percentage of lifetime in the U.S., and Vietnamese and English fluency. We conducted a multiple logistic regression controlling for age, sex, education, and household income. The sample was an average 37.5 years old and 61.6% female.

In particular, older adults avoided seeking medical treatment for fear of infection or had their medical treatments postponed or denied by health facilities or health professionals. In response, remote medical services were recognized as an essential adjustment mechanism to maintain the continuity of healthcare provision. Using the SHARE Corona Survey data, we estimate logistic and multilevel regression models for the remote care of 44,152 persons aged 50 and over in 27 European countries and Israel. Our findings suggest that those aged 80+ were the least likely to use remote healthcare. However, women, better educated individuals, older adults who lived in urban areas, those with no financial strain, and active Internet users used remote medical consultations more often. Those who reported poor or fair health status, two or more chronic diseases, or hospitalization in the last 12 months were significantly more likely to use remote healthcare. Furthermore, remote medical consultations were more frequent for those who had their healthcare postponed or went without it due to fear of coronavirus infection. Finally, older adults used remote care more frequently in countries with less healthcare coverage and lower health expenditures. Health systems should prioritize vulnerable groups in maintaining continuity in access to healthcare, despite the availability of remote care. Policymakers should improve telemedicine regulation and offer incentives for providers of remote healthcare services by adapting reimbursement policies.

The regulatory potential of procedural justice in the context of compliance with medical advice and the treatment process.,2023,journal article,Frontiers in medicine,Frontiers Media SA,Switzerland,Tomasz Prusiński,"The main aim of the study was to find empirical evidence to answer the following question: If an important personal interest-namely, health and the prospect of a long life-is not enough to motivate a person to follow recommendations from doctors and medical experts, what factor plays a significant role? The author tested the regulatory potential of procedural justice in this context. The sample consisted of 210 participants, patients of independent primary healthcare facilities and specialist hospital outpatient clinics. The empirical data were analyzed by means of structural equation modeling (SEM). Seven SEM models were tested in the analyses. The adopted analytical strategy brought valuable results. The study supported the main hypothesized relationship, showing that procedural justice was a factor increasing the acceptance of and compliance with medical advice and doctor's perceived competence. The results of analyses indicate that the fair treatment of patients in healthcare institutions can be regarded as a significant factor regulating patients' health behavior. The procedural effect is significant for increasing patients' positive evaluation of doctors' competence. Also, the evaluation of a doctor as competent increases patient compliance.",Competence (human resources); Compliance (psychology); Procedural justice; Context (archaeology); Structural equation modeling; Psychology; Empirical research; Medical advice; Economic Justice; Sample (material); Health care; Medicine; Medical education; Nursing; Social psychology; Political science; Law; Paleontology; Philosophy; Statistics; Chemistry; Mathematics; Epistemology; Chromatography; Neuroscience; Perception; Biology,doctor’s competence; healthcare system; medical advice; patient compliance; procedural justice,,10.3389/fmed.2023.1004994,true

Design Cross-sectional survey data drawn from a population-based longitudinal study when children were aged 4–5 years. Setting Population-based study of Australian children and their families. Participants 8137 fathers participated in the study when their children were aged 4–5 years. There were 131 (1.6%) fathers of likely refugee background, 872 (10.7%) fathers who migrated from English-speaking countries, 1005 (12.4%) fathers who migrated from non-English-speaking countries and 6129 (75.3%) Australian-born fathers. Primary outcome measures Fathers’ psychological distress was assessed using the self-report Kessler-6. Information pertaining to physical health conditions, global or overall health, alcohol and tobacco use, and body mass index status was obtained. Results Compared with Australian-born fathers, fathers of likely refugee background (adjusted OR(aOR) 3.17, 95% CI 2.13 to 4.74) and fathers from non-English-speaking countries (aOR 1.79, 95%CI 1.51 to 2.13) had higher odds of psychological distress. Refugee fathers were more likely to report fair to poor overall health (aOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.60) and being underweight (aOR 3.49, 95% CI 1.57 to 7.74) compared with Australian-born fathers. Refugee fathers and those from non-English-speaking countries were less likely to report light (aOR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.43, and aOR 0.30, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.37, respectively) and moderate to harmful alcohol use (aOR 0.04, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.17, and aOR 0.14, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.19, respectively) than Australian-born fathers. Finally, fathers from non-English-speaking and English-speaking countries were less likely to be overweight (aOR 0.62, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.75, and aOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.03, respectively) and obese (aOR 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.58, and aOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98, respectively) than Australian-born fathers. Conclusion Fathers of refugee background experience poorer mental health and poorer general health than Australian-born fathers. Fathers who have migrated from non-English-speaking countries also report greater psychological distress than Australian-born fathers. This underscores the need for primary healthcare services to tailor efforts to reduce disparities in health outcomes for refugee populations that may be vulnerable due to circumstances and sequelae of forced migration and to recognise the additional psychological stresses that may accompany fatherhood following migration from non-English-speaking countries. It is important to note that refugee and migrant fathers report less alcohol use and are less likely to be overweight and obese than Australian-born fathers.",Psychiatry; Mental health; Cross-sectional study; Demography; Refugee; Longitudinal study; Overweight; Underweight; Population; Immigration; Medicine,depression; fathers; men; mental health; migration; refugees,"Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Australia; Body Mass Index; Cigarette Smoking; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fathers/psychology; Health Status; Humans; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Odds Ratio; Refugees/psychology; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological/etiology; Transients and Migrants/psychology",10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015603,true

The healthcare systems are overwhelmed because of this virus. The intensive care unit (ICU) as a part of the healthcare sector has faced several challenges due to the poor information quality provided by current ICUs’ medical equipment management. IoT has raised the ability for vital data transfer in the healthcare sector of the new century. However, most of the existing paradigms have adopted IoT technology to track patients’ health statuses. Therefore, there is a lack of understanding on how to utilize such technology for ICUs’ medical equipment management. This paper proposes a novel IoT-based paradigm called IoT Based Paradigm for Medical Equipment Management Systems (IoT MEMS) to manage medical equipment of ICUs efficiently. It employs IoT technology to enhance the information flow between medical equipment management systems (THIS) and ICUs during the COVID-19 outbreak to ensure the highest level of transparency and fairness in reallocating medical equipment. We described in detail the theoretical and practical aspects of IoT MEMS. Adopting IoT MEMS will enhance hospital capacity and capability in mitigating COVID-19 efficiently.

King,"This research extends the group engagement model (GEM) to examine how fairness judgments implicate both organizational-level and individual-level outcomes, including patient health and satisfaction (i.e., patient health outcomes) and employee health. Based on the social identity arguments of the GEM, we argue that fair career advancement procedures at the organizational level and experiences of discrimination at the individual level are indicators of identity-based evaluations of fairness. Utilizing annual staff survey data from the National Health Service (NHS) in the U.K. (n = 147 hospitals with n = 60,602 employees), we observe that organizational fairness of career advancement procedures significantly relates to patient health through the hospital-level mediator, employee voice. Individual fairness of an employee's personal experience with discrimination significantly relates to employee health through the individual-level mediator, psychological safety. Results support the three-stage indirect effect from organizational-level fairness to employee health via individual-level fairness and individual-level psychological safety. In supplemental studies, measurement limitations are addressed through multitrait multimethod matrix and content validation approaches. These results indicate that the archival NHS measures sufficiently operationalize the constructs of interest providing further support for the hypothesized model.

Google Trends™ (GT) analyses indicate changes of public interest in a topic over time, and can be correlated with incidence of health events such as concussion. Internet searches represent a primary means of patient education for many health topics, including concussion; however, the quality of medical information yielded by internet searches is variable and frequently of an inappropriate reading level. This study therefore aims to describe GT over time and evaluate the quality and readability of information produced by Google™ searches of the term ""concussion."" We identified a strong negative correlation from 2009 to 2016 between GT scores and total number of American high school football participants (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.8553) and participants per school (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.9533). Between 2004 and 2020, the monthly GT popularity score were variable (<i>p</i> = 3.193E-08), with September having the greatest scores, correlating with the height of American tackle football season. Applying five validated quality assessment scoring systems at two time points, it was confirmed that different sources yielded varying quality of information. Academic and non-profit healthcare sources demonstrated the highest quality metrics across two time points. There was significant variability of scores among the different scoring systems, however. The majority of searches at both time points yielded information that was rated as ""fair"" to ""poor"" in quality. Applying six readability tests, we revealed that only a single commercial website offered information written at or below the American Medical Association- recommended 6th-grade level for healthcare information. In summary, GT data analyses suggest that searches correlate with the American tackle football season and increased between 2009 and 2016, given that public interest in concussion increased and annual participation in football decreased.

Cervical cancer is a potentially preventable disease if appropriate screening and prophylactic strategies are employed. However, lack of knowledge and awareness can result in underutilization of the preventive strategies. Healthcare professionals with adequate knowledge play a huge role in influencing the beliefs and practices of the general public in a positive way. We assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of cervical cancer and screening amongst female healthcare professionals at King Fahad Medical City (KFMC), Saudi Arabia. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study on female healthcare professionals at KFMC. Data were collected using a predesigned, tested, and self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included specific sections to test the participants’ knowledge, attitude, and practices related to cervical cancer and its screening. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics. Results. Data from 395 participants were included in the final analysis. The majority of the study participants were nurses (n = 261, 66.1%). The mean age of the participants was 34.7 years and 239 (60.5%) participants were married. Only 16 (4.0%) participants appeared to have good level knowledge of cervical cancer (in terms of risk factors, vulnerability, signs and symptoms, ways of prevention, and ways of screening) and 58 (14.7%) participants had fair level knowledge. A total of 343 (86.8%) participants believed that Pap smear test is a useful test for the detection of cervical cancer and 103 (26.2%) participants had undergone Pap smear testing. Conclusions. Our study population showed poor knowledge of cervical cancer as a disease. The participants had a fair knowledge of Pap smear testing, but only a quarter of the cohort had undergone testing themselves.

Zimmerman,"The minimum wage creates both winners (through wage increases) and—potentially—losers (through job losses). Research on the health effects of minimum wage policies has been sparse, particularly across gender and among racial/ethnic minorities. We test the impact of minimum wage increases on health outcomes, health behaviors and access to healthcare across gender and race/ethnicity. Using 1993–2014 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, variables for access to healthcare (insurance coverage, missed care due to cost), health behavior (exercise, fruit, vegetable and alcohol consumption) and health outcomes (self-reported fair/poor health, hypertension, poor physical health days, poor mental health days, unhealthy days) were regressed on the product of the ratio of the 1-year lagged minimum wage to the state median wage and the national median wage, using Linear Probability Models and Poisson Regression Models for dichotomous and count outcomes, respectively. Regressions (total population, gender-stratified, race/ethnicity stratified (white, black, Latino), gender/race/ethnicity stratified and total population with interaction terms for race/ethnicity/gender) controlled for state-level ecologic variables, individual-level demographics and fixed-effects (state and year). Results were adjusted for complex survey design and Bonferroni corrections were applied to p-values such that the level of statistical significance for a given outcome category was 0.05 divided by the number of outcomes in that category. Minimum wage increases were positively associated with access to care among white men, black women and Latino women but negatively associated with access to care among white women and black men. With respect to dietary quality, minimum wage increases were associated with improvements, mixed results and negative impacts among white, Latino and black men, respectively. With respect to health outcomes, minimum wage increases were associated with positive, negative and mixed impacts among white women, white men and Latino men, respectively. While there is enthusiasm for minimum wage increases in the public health community, such increases may have to be paired with deliberate strategies to protect workers that might be vulnerable to economic dislocation. Such strategies may include more robust unemployment insurance or increased access to job training for displaced workers.",Ethnic group; Public health; Demography; Health care; Health equity; Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; Wage; Minimum wage; Medicine; Poisson regression,Health disparities; Minimum wage; Public policy; Race/ethnicity,Adult; Ethnicity/statistics & numerical data; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Racial Groups/statistics & numerical data; Salaries and Fringe Benefits/statistics & numerical data; Sex Factors; United States; Young Adult,10.1186/s12889-019-7376-y,true

A 36-item questionnaire was used to elicit data regarding demographics, patient's health status, procedures, and hospitalization history and awareness and knowledge about SSIs.A total of 375 patients were included (equally for all five regions of Saudi Arabia). Most patients were male (55.7%) and aged 18-34 years (44%). Most respondents (49.1%) had poor awareness; being illiterate and from the Northern region were significant factors (P = 0.001). Patients with no history of surgery (P = 0.001) or SSI (P = 0.003) also had poor awareness levels. In terms of knowledge, 45.8% and 35.2% of the participants had fair and poor knowledge, respectively, with the level of knowledge being significantly associated with region (P = 0.001). Patients those aged >65 years had poor knowledge (P = 0.033), while of males had good knowledge (P = 0.02). Patients with no history of surgery had poor knowledge of SSIs (P = 0.003).

Carlson; Elizabeth Brouwer; Eunice Kim; Phoebe Wright; R. Brett McQueen,"Abstract Objectives The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) has been long debated, but alternative estimation approaches have not been comprehensively evaluated. Our objective was to identify alternatives, characterize them by implementation feasibility, and evaluate the impact of implementing feasible options in cost-effectiveness models developed for the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review reports. Methods We conducted a literature review combining keywords relating to QALYs, methodology alternatives, and cost-effectiveness in PubMed, EconLit, Web of Science, and MEDLINE. Articles that discussed alternatives to the conventional QALY were included. Alternatives were characterized by type, data availability, calculation burden, and overall implementation feasibility. The subset of feasible alternatives, that is, sufficient data and methodology compatible with incorporation into common modeling approaches, were evaluated according to impact on incremental QALYs, incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB), intervention rankings, and proportion of interventions with a positive iNMB. Results We identified 28 articles discussing 9 alternatives. Feasible alternatives were using patient preference (PP) data; equity weighting according to baseline utility, fair innings, or proportional QALY shortfall; and the equal value of life-years-gained approach. All alternatives affected the incremental QALY and iNMB outcomes, rankings, and proportion of interventions with a positive iNMB. The PP alternative had the largest and most consistent impact. The PP impact on the proportion of interventions with a positive iNMB, was in the negative direction. Conclusions Our work is the first comprehensive evaluation of proposed alternatives to the conventional QALY. We found robust literature but few options that were feasible to be implemented in current healthcare decision-making processes.",Actuarial science; Weighting; Psychological intervention; Economic evaluation; MEDLINE; Cost effectiveness; Computer science; Quality-adjusted life year; Impact evaluation; Estimation,QALY; cost-effectiveness; economic evaluation; value,"Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Models, Statistical; Quality-Adjusted Life Years",10.1016/j.jval.2020.08.2092,true

The latter offers the capacity to rationalize, understand and use big data to serve many different purposes, from improved services modelling to prediction of treatment outcomes, to greater patient and disease stratification. In the area of infectious diseases, the application of big data analytics has introduced a number of changes in the information accumulation models. These are discussed by comparing the traditional and new models of data accumulation. Big data analytics is fast becoming a crucial component for the modelling of transmission-aiding infection control measures and policies-emergency response analyses required during local or international outbreaks. However, the application of big data analytics in infectious diseases is coupled with a number of ethical impacts. Four key areas are discussed in this paper: (i) automation and algorithmic reliance impacting freedom of choice, (ii) big data analytics complexity impacting informed consent, (iii) reliance on profiling impacting individual and group identities and justice/fair access and (iv) increased surveillance and population intervention capabilities impacting behavioural norms and practices. Furthermore, the extension of big data analytics to include information derived from personal devices, such as mobile phones and wearables as part of infectious disease frameworks in the near future and their potential ethical impacts are discussed. Considered together, the need for a constructive and transparent inclusion of ethical questioning in this rapidly evolving field becomes an increasing necessity in order to provide a moral foundation for the societal acceptance and responsible development of the technological advancement.",Wearable computer; Philosophy of technology; Health care; Data science; Constructive; Freedom of choice; Computer science; Accrual; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Big data,Big data analytics; Ethics; Infectious diseases; Mobile phones; Wearables,,10.1007/s13347-017-0278-y,true

Thompson; Lu Jiang; Constance Hammen; Shannon E. Whaley,"Objectives The present study sought to examine the association between maternal depressive symptoms and characteristics of offspring physical health, including health status, health behaviors, and healthcare utilization, among low-income families. Maternal engagement was explored as a mediator of observed effects. Methods Cross-sectional survey data from a community sample of 4589 low-income women and their preschool-age children participating in the WIC program in Los Angeles County were analyzed using logistic, Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Mediation was tested via conditional process analyses. Results After controlling for the effects of demographic characteristics including maternal health insurance coverage, employment status, education, and preferred language, children of depressed women (N = 1025) were significantly more likely than children of non-depressed women (N = 3564) to receive a ""poor"" or ""fair"" maternal rating of general health (OR 2.34), eat fewer vegetables (IRR: 0.94) more sweets (IRR: 1.20) and sugary drinks daily (IRR: 1.32), and consume fast food more often (OR 1.21). These children were also less likely to have health insurance (OR 1.59) and more likely to receive medical care from a public medical clinic or hospital emergency room (OR 1.30). Reduced maternal engagement partially mediated associations between maternal depressive symptoms and several child health outcomes including poor diet, health insurance coverage, and use of public medical services. Conclusions for Practice Maternal depressive symptoms are associated with poor health among preschool-age children in low-income families.

From computers, mobile phones, smart watches or your virtual assistants, everything is connected to the complex web of IoT. With the technological development in this century, healthcare sector has also had its fair share of innovations including innovation related to healthcare, diagnostics, sensors, or even data analytic along with development in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. IoT in healthcare is expected to help improve the quality of life for the people due to the flexibility that it provides. We looked at the significant amount of work done in this sector, and found a trend that COVID-19 has only spurred the development of this field. We explored both the benefits and challenges that IoT in Healthcare might possess and have addressed challenges such as data security, cloud integration problems. Additionally, we looked at the issue of data security in depth and along with the current method of LSCSH being used, we have recommended that Zero-trust architecture being used as well as it caters to the needs of the evolving data management space. From 2013, IoT in healthcare has dominated the space as new devices are released and there has been a boom of devices that are being developed and being researched on. Most of the devices are affordable and some can even be accessed with a small subscription fee. Our results show us that IoT has started to pick up its popularity since 2015 as companies succeeded to win the trust of the market.

Methods: Data were collected from 264 nonurgent patients diverted from the ED of a tertiary public university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The nonurgent patient definition was performed by Manchester triage system version II (MTS-II) associated to medical interview in the triage service. Satisfaction levels were evaluated by telephone interviews. The outcomes were assessed within 30 days after the ED visit. Results: Based on the MTS-II, 56.4 percent of the diverted patients were classified as green, 34.3 percent as blue, and 9.3 percent as white. Only one patient required a hospital admission and no deaths were registered within 30 days after ED diversion. After diversion, the majority of patients searched for PHS (62.7 percent), 14.4 percent sought out other EDs, and 22.9 percent did not seek out any other health services. Regarding patient satisfaction, 61.9 percent evaluated the triage team as fair, good, or very good. Conclusions: Our study suggests that diverting nonurgent patients from the ED to PHS may be carried out in a hierarchic system like the Brazilian public healthcare system. The MTS-II can be a useful triage system to support physician in the diverting process. In addition, patient satisfaction with the refusing was reasonable.

This study is aimed at identifying the best clinical model to predict poststroke independence at 6 and 18 months, considering sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and then identifying differences between countries. Methods. Data was retrieved from the International Stroke Trial 3 study. Nine clinical variables (age, gender, severity, rt-PA, living alone, atrial fibrillation, history of transient ischemic attack/stroke, and abilities to lift arms and walk) were measured immediately after the stroke and considered to predict independence at 6 and 18 months poststroke. Independence was measured using the Oxford Handicap Scale. The adequacy, predictive capacity, and discriminative capacity of the models were checked. Countries were added to the final models. Results. At 6 months poststroke, 35.8% ( ) of participants were independent, and at 18 months, this proportion decreased to 29.9% ( ). Both 6 and 18 months poststroke predictive models obtained fair discriminatory capacities. Gender, living alone, and rt-PA only reached predictive significance at 18 months. Poststroke patients from Poland and Sweden showed greater chances to achieve independence at 6 months compared to the UK. Poland also achieved greater chances at 18 months. Italy had worse chances than the UK at both follow-ups. Discussion. Six and eight variables predicted poststroke independence at 6 and 18 months, respectively. Some variables only reached significance at 18 months, suggesting a late influence in stroke patients’ rehabilitation. Differences found between countries in achieving independence may be related to healthcare system organization or cultural characteristics, a hypothesis that must be addressed in future studies. These results can allow the development of tailored interventions to improve the outcomes.",Physical therapy; Independence; Rehabilitation; Atrial fibrillation; Tailored interventions; Secondary analysis; Ischemic stroke; Stroke; Scale (social sciences); Medicine,,,10.1155/2021/5627868,true

This is badly needed, largely desirable and uncontroversial. However, historically, medical and healthcare practices and their informatics processes assume that individual clinical encounters between practitioners and patients are the indispensable foundation of clinical practice. This assumption has been dramatically challenged by expansion of digital technologies, their interconnectable mobility, virtuality, surveillance informatics, and the vastness of data repositories for individuals and populations that enable and support them. This article is a brief historical commentary emphasizing critical ethical issues about decisions in clinical interactions or encounters raised in the early days of the field. These questions, raised eloquently by François Grémy in 1985, have become urgently relevant to the equity/fairness, inclusivity and unbiasedness desired of today's pervasive digital health systems.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVES"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">The main goal of this article is to highlight how the personal freedoms of choice, values, and responsibilities arising in relationships between physicians and healthcare practitioners and their patients in the clinical encounter can be distorted by digital health technologies which focus more on efficiency, productivity, and scalability of healthcare processes. Understanding the promise and limitations of early and current decision-support systems and the analytics of community or population data can help place into historical context the often exaggerated claims made today about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning ""solving"" clinical problems with algorithms and data, downplaying the role of the clinical judgments and responsibilities inherent in personal clinical encounters.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">A review of selected early articles in medical informatics is related to current literature on the ethical issues and technological inadequacies involved in the design and implementation of clinical systems for decision-making. Early insights and cautions about the development of decision support technologies raised questions about the ethical responsibilities in clinical encounters where freedom of personal choice can be so easily limited through the constraints from information processing and reliance on prior expertise frequently driven more by administrative rather than clinical objectives. These anticipated many of the deeper ethical problems that have arisen since then in clinical informatics.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Early papers on ethics in clinical decision-making provide prescient commentary on the dangers of not taking into account the complexities of individual human decision making in clinical encounters. These include the excessive reliance on data and experts, and oversimplified models of human reasoning, all of which persist and have become amplified today as urgent questions about how inclusivity, equity, and bias are handled in practical systems where ethical responsibilities of individuals patients and practitioners intertwine with those of groups within professional or other communities, and are central to how clinical encounters evolve in our digital health future.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>IMIA and Thieme.

These practice guidelines not only help to minimize the spread of infection among patients but also help to avoid healthcare workers from contracting infections when caring for patients. Nursing students are equally at risk to exposure to infections during their clinical attachments in the healthcare setting. Hence, this study aims to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and compliance toward standard precautions among undergraduate nursing students in Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS). It also aims to identify the associations between knowledge, attitude, and compliance toward standard precautions among UNIMAS nursing students. Data was collected from a total of 167 participants using a self-administered questionnaire which was disseminated online via Google Forms. The data collection tool consisted of a 46-item structured questionnaire in 4-parts investigating participant’s sociodemographic profile, knowledge, attitude and compliance towards standard precautions. Study participants consisted of students from the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (with honours) Programme in UNIMAS. Data collected were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and was further analyzed using IBM SPSS version 26. Majority of participants in the study demonstrated very good (46.7%, n=78) and good knowledge (50.9%, n=85) levels while only a minority demonstrated fair knowledge (2.4%, n=4) with none exhibiting low knowledge levels toward standard precautions. Most nursing students (97.6%, n=163) investigated in this study showed positive attitudes toward standard precautions practices. Most study participants self-reported their compliance toward standard precaution practices as high (89.8%, n=150) with a minority reporting average (7.8%, n=13), low (0.6%, n=1) and very low (1.8%, n=3) compliance respectively. Further analyses revealed significant correlations between knowledge and attitude (r= .165, p=.033, p&lt; .05); and attitude and compliance (r= -.505, p=.000, p&lt; .05) with no significant correlations between knowledge and compliance (r= -.036, p=.645, p&gt; .05). Undergraduate nursing students of UNIMAS in this study demonstrated desirably good knowledge levels and positive attitudes with a high level of compliance toward standard precautions practices. Despite the overall desirable findings, there is still room for targeted improvements in the undergraduate programme delivery specifically aimed at misconceptions regarding the use of personal protection equipment (PPE) to maintain and further enhance student’s knowledge, attitudes and compliance toward standard precautions.</jats:p>",Standard precautions; Bachelor; Medicine; Health care; Nursing; Microsoft excel; Universal precautions; Compliance (psychology); Family medicine; Infection control; Psychology; Surgery; Social psychology; Archaeology; Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); Computer science; Economics; History; Economic growth; Operating system,,,10.33736/tur.4536.2022,true

We screened 5859 patients with complete sociodemographics and data at baseline. Thirty-eight percent (2248 of 5859) of these patients had complete data at 3 months. Finally, participants were eligible for inclusion if they provided a relevant answer to the three patient-reported experience measure (PREM) items. A total of 424 patients did not do this because they answered ""I don't know"" or ""not applicable"" to a PREM item, leaving 31% (1824 of 5859) for inclusion in the final sample. A validated Satisfaction with Treatment Result Questionnaire was administered at 3 months, which identified the patients' level of satisfaction with treatment results so far on a 5-point Likert scale (research question 1, with answers of poor, moderate, fair, good, or excellent) and the patients' willingness to undergo the treatment again under similar circumstances (research question 2, with answers of yes or no). A hierarchical logistic regression model was used to identify whether baseline sociodemographics, quality of life, change in outcome (patient-reported outcome measures for hand function and pain), baseline measures of mental health (including treatment credibility [the extent to which a patient attributes credibility to a treatment] and expectations, illness perception, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression), and PREMs were associated with each question of the Satisfaction with Treatment Result Questionnaire at 3 months post-treatment. We dichotomized responses to our first question as good and excellent, which were considered more satisfied, and poor, moderate, and fair, which were considered less satisfied.

We employ retail fairness as our theoretical lens to address this seeming paradox and conduct a discrete choice experiment with 16 attributes to better understand consumers' fairness perceptions of DTC genetic testing business models. Our results suggest that, while consumers perceive privacy-preserving DTC genetic testing services fairer, price is the main driver for fairness perception. We contribute to research on consumer perceptions of DTC genetic testing by investigating consumer preferences of DTC genetic testing business models and respective attributes. Further, this research contributes to knowledge about disruptive business models in healthcare and retail fairness by contextualizing the concept of retail fairness in the DTC genetic testing market.

However, there is a gap of operational guidance for performing reliability and fairness audits in practice. Following guideline recommendations, we conducted a reliability audit of two models based on model performance and calibration as well as a fairness audit based on summary statistics, subgroup performance and subgroup calibration. We assessed the Epic End-of-Life (EOL) Index model and an internally developed Stanford Hospital Medicine (HM) Advance Care Planning (ACP) model in 3 practice settings: Primary Care, Inpatient Oncology and Hospital Medicine, using clinicians' answers to the surprise question (""Would you be surprised if [patient X] passed away in [Y years]?"") as a surrogate outcome. For performance, the models had positive predictive value (PPV) at or above 0.76 in all settings. In Hospital Medicine and Inpatient Oncology, the Stanford HM ACP model had higher sensitivity (0.69, 0.89 respectively) than the EOL model (0.20, 0.27), and better calibration (O/E 1.5, 1.7) than the EOL model (O/E 2.5, 3.0). The Epic EOL model flagged fewer patients (11%, 21% respectively) than the Stanford HM ACP model (38%, 75%). There were no differences in performance and calibration by sex. Both models had lower sensitivity in Hispanic/Latino male patients with Race listed as ""Other."" 10 clinicians were surveyed after a presentation summarizing the audit. 10/10 reported that summary statistics, overall performance, and subgroup performance would affect their decision to use the model to guide care; 9/10 said the same for overall and subgroup calibration. The most commonly identified barriers for routinely conducting such reliability and fairness audits were poor demographic data quality and lack of data access. This audit required 115 person-hours across 8-10 months. Our recommendations for performing reliability and fairness audits include verifying data validity, analyzing model performance on intersectional subgroups, and collecting clinician-patient linkages as necessary for label generation by clinicians. Those responsible for AI models should require such audits before model deployment and mediate between model auditors and impacted stakeholders.",Audit; Medicine; Guideline; Reliability (semiconductor); Health care; Emergency medicine; Family medicine; Accounting; Power (physics); Physics; Pathology; Quantum mechanics; Economics; Business; Economic growth,advance care planning; artificial intelligence; audit; electronic health record; fairness; model reporting guideline,,10.3389/fdgth.2022.943768,true

Nowadays, enhancement on medical diagnosis via machine learning models has been highly effective in many aspects of e-health analytics. Nevertheless, in the classic cloud-based/centralized e-health paradigms, all the data will be centrally stored on the server to facilitate model training, which inevitably incurs privacy concerns and high time delay. Distributed solutions like Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (D-SGD) are proposed to provide safe and timely diagnostic results based on personal devices. However, methods like D-SGD are subject to the gradient vanishing issue and usually proceed slowly at the early training stage, thereby impeding the effectiveness and efficiency of training. In addition, existing methods are prone to learning models that are biased towards users with dense data, compromising the fairness when providing E-health analytics for minority groups. In this paper, we propose a Decentralized Block Coordinate Descent (D-BCD) learning framework that can better optimize deep neural network-based models distributed on decentralized devices for E-health analytics. As a gradient-free optimization method, Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) mitigates the gradient vanishing issue and converges faster at the early stage compared with the conventional gradient-based optimization. To overcome the potential data scarcity issues for users' local data, we propose similarity-based model aggregation that allows each on-device model to leverage knowledge from similar neighbor models, so as to achieve both personalization and high accuracy for the learned models. Benchmarking experiments on three real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed D-BCD, where additional simulation study showcases the strong applicability of D-BCD in real-life E-health scenarios.",Computer science; Analytics; Stochastic gradient descent; Coordinate descent; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Leverage (statistics); Block (permutation group theory); Cloud computing; Deep learning; Gradient descent; Distributed computing; Data mining; Artificial neural network; Geometry; Mathematics; Operating system,,"Computer Simulation; Humans; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Privacy; Telemedicine",10.1109/jbhi.2022.3140455,true

The American Heart Association recommends that TM may be considered in clinical practice. Objective To provide an overview of all systematic reviews and meta-analyses of TM on BP for evidence-informed clinical decision making. Method Systematic searches of PubMed, EBSCOhost, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, and PsycINFO for all systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with TM as an intervention, and outcome measures include systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). Qualitative and quantitative data were synthesized. The methodological quality of the selected reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR checklist. Results Eight systematic reviews and meta-analyses are included. Among them is an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality report, a Cochrane systematic review, 4 independent reviews, and 2 reviews from a TM related institution. The quality of most of the included reviews is fair with a mean score of 5.75/11 on the AMSTAR scale. Overall, there exists a clear trend of increasing evidence over the years supporting the efficacy of TM in lowering BP . However, some conflicting findings remain across reviews and potential risk of bias exists in many of the RCTs included in these reviews.

Maryam Hosseini; Milad Sikaroudi; Morteza Babaie; H.R. Tizhoosh,"Medical centers and healthcare providers have concerns and hence restrictions around sharing data with external collaborators. Federated learning, as a privacy-preserving method, involves learning a site-independent model without having direct access to patient-sensitive data in a distributed collaborative fashion. The federated approach relies on decentralized data distribution from various hospitals and clinics. The collaboratively learned global model is supposed to have acceptable performance for the individual sites. However, existing methods focus on minimizing the average of the aggregated loss functions, leading to a biased model that performs perfectly for some hospitals while exhibiting undesirable performance for other sites. In this paper, we improve model “fairness” among participating hospitals by proposing a novel federated learning scheme called <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">Proportionally Fair Federated Learning</i> , short Prop-FFL.

In 2007, the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance Scheme(URBMS) was inaugurated, which aimed to cover all urban residents who are out of the labor market. However, the accessibility and fairness of the healthcare service have hindered the progress of universal healthcare. At the beginning of 2010, the Integration of Urban and Rural Medical Insurance Scheme(IURMIS) was implemented to bridge the gap in medical care between urban and rural areas. The main objective of this study is to determine the extent to which the IURMIS has been successful. The statistical software packages SPSS 19.0 and STATA 12.0 were used for all analyses, and P < 0.05 was set as the required level of significance. Data were collected from outpatients from 2009 (July to December, n = 20,459) through 2011 (n = 65,258 in 2010, n = 59,036 in 2011) and from inpatients in 2011 (n = 3662). Due to the enormous amount of data and the short time span, most of our analysis was descriptive. However, regression discontinuity (RD) and the chi-squared (χ2) test were used to compare the ratios of medical expenses before and after the IURMIS. In the RD analysis, there was a downward trend in the mean medical expense (Coef. = − 0.66, P < 0.001), and rural outpatients flowed to township hospitals and village clinics after the implementation of the IURMIS (Coef. = − 0.45, P < 0.001). However, compensation expenses showed an upward trend (Coef. = 11.59, P < 0.001). In the analysis of inpatient expenses, the average expenses (CNY 2067) and hospitalization days (10.0) for all the hospitals were less than those in the Chinese Fourth National Health Services Survey (CNY 3412 and 10.3, respectively). Rural residents’ healthcare options and quality were improved and medical expenses were significantly reduced after implementation of the scheme.

A dashboard was developed and iteratively updated as additional CEUAMs were approved. The dashboard tracked CEUAM distribution and monitoring at the national, regional, facility, and patient level. Par stock levels were initially determined at the national level. Facilities were also able to request an additional allotment of medication based on demand and allocated supplies from the Department of Health and Human Services. Providers completed a questionnaire for the CEUAM for each patient to ensure all requirements for the medication were met. If there were data integrity concerns, the entry was flagged for review at the facility level and, upon evaluation, corrections were made.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Development of the dashboard was resource intensive but provided an excellent mechanism to share information among facilities and national offices.

Paulus; David M. Kent,"The machine learning community has become alert to the ways that predictive algorithms can inadvertently introduce unfairness in decision-making. Herein, we discuss how concepts of algorithmic fairness might apply in healthcare, where predictive algorithms are being increasingly used to support decision-making. Central to our discussion is the distinction between algorithmic fairness and algorithmic bias. Fairness concerns apply specifically when algorithms are used to support polar decisions (i.e., where one pole of prediction leads to decisions that are generally more desired than the other), such as when predictions are used to allocate scarce health care resources to a group of patients that could all benefit. We review different fairness criteria and demonstrate their mutual incompatibility. Even when models are used to balance benefits-harms to make optimal decisions for individuals (i.e., for non-polar decisions)–and fairness concerns are not germane–model, data or sampling issues can lead to biased predictions that support decisions that are differentially harmful/beneficial across groups. We review these potential sources of bias, and also discuss ways to diagnose and remedy algorithmic bias. We note that remedies for algorithmic fairness may be more problematic, since we lack agreed upon definitions of fairness. Finally, we propose a provisional framework for the evaluation of clinical prediction models offered for further elaboration and refinement. Given the proliferation of prediction models used to guide clinical decisions, developing consensus for how these concerns can be addressed should be prioritized.",Medical research; Risk analysis (engineering); Health care; Health equity; Computer science; Predictive modelling; Predictive analytics,Health care; Medical research,,10.1038/s41746-020-0304-9,true

Data is collected all over the world and needs to be integrated and made available to other researchers quickly. However, the various heterogeneous information systems that are used in hospitals can result in fragmentation of health data over multiple data 'silos' that are not interoperable for analysis. Consequently, clinical observations in hospitalised patients are not prepared to be reused efficiently and timely. There is a need to adapt the research data management in hospitals to make COVID-19 observational patient data machine actionable, i.e. more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) for humans and machines.

M. Some; Christy Pu; Song Lih Huang,"BACKGROUND In Burkina Faso, gender inequality prevents women from meeting their reproductive needs, leading to high rates of unintended pregnancies, abortions and deaths. Evidence shows that empowering women may increase the proportion of demand for family planning satisfied using modern methods (mDFPS), but few studies have measured this process in multiple spheres of life. We investigated how empowerment influences the mDFPS among married women of reproductive age (MWRA) in Burkina Faso. METHODS We analyzed data from the 2010 Burkina Faso Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) on 4714 MWRA with reproductive needs living in 573 communities. We used principal component analysis (PCA) and Cronbach's alpha test to explore and assess specific and consistently relevant components of women's agency in marital relationships. Aggregated measures at the cluster level were used to assess gender norms and relationships in communities. Descriptive statistics were performed and multilevel logistic regression models were carried out to concurrently gauge the effects of women's agency and community-level of gender equality on mDFPS, controlling for socioeconomic factors. RESULTS Overall, less than one-third (30.8%) of the demand for family planning among MWRA were satisfied with modern methods. Participation in household decision-making, freedom in accessing healthcare, and opposition to domestic violence were underlying components of women's agency in marital relationships. In the full model adjusted for socioeconomic status, freedom in accessing healthcare was significantly (aOR 1.27, CI 1.06-1.51) associated with mDFPS. For community-level variables, women's greater access to assets (aOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.13-2.61) and family planning messages (aOR 2.68, 95% CI 1.64-4.36) increased mDFPS, while higher fertility expectations (aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64-0.87) reduced it. Unexpectedly, women in communities with higher rates of female genital mutilation were more likely (aOR 2.46, 95% CI 1.52-3.99) to have mDFPS. CONCLUSIONS Empowering women has the potential to reduce gender inequality, raise women's agency and increase mDFPS. This influence may occur through both balanced marital relationships and fair community gender norms and relationships. Progress toward universal access to reproductive services should integrate the promotion of women's rights.

Areas of controversy It is not always clear that hospices can be described as 'specialist', which can make it difficult for hospices to negotiate appropriate commissioning arrangements with the statutory sector. Growing points Children's palliative care generally is poorly developed compared with the adult specialty, and local providers should work with hospices to help redress the inequity that children face in accessing specialist palliative care.

The sudden and fast spread of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide caused a sudden increase in the workload of health care workers in parallel with the possible increase in mortality rates and the spread of this disease to a large number of people. Clinicians, who are our frontline warriors, are not only at high risk of catching COVID-19, but their mental health is also at stake. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of anxiety and its association with the working environment in clinical professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional study collected data from 400 medical doctors through an online survey, carried out for six months. The anxiety of participants was assessed by using the Zung Self Rating anxiety scale (SAS). An anxiety index of greater than or equal to 50 was marked as anxious. Descriptive chi-square analysis and correlation analysis were used. Results This study found that out of a total, 20.1% of the participants suffered from anxiety. Anxiety was found to be positively associated with sociodemographic factors like the age of the doctor (p=0.001), their gender (p=0.000), their working environment (p=0.005), working in basic healthcare units (p=0.015), patient load per week (p=0.005), personal protective equipment (PPE) availability to doctor according to WHO guidelines (p=0.007), and patient compliance with doctors' orders (p=0.009). Conclusion We conclude that professional healthcare workers suffered from anxiety due to working conditions in the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific interventions and steps such as improving staffing and resources, policies to ensure fair distribution of working hours and rest breaks, workplace protections, work-family balance, health professional's emotional stability, and long-term benefits should be taken so as to minimize the lasting effects of these factors.",Psychiatry; Mental health; Health care; Psychological intervention; Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale; Staffing; Workload; Anxiety; Medicine; Pandemic,anxiety; clinical professionals; covid-19; working environment; zung anxiety scale,,10.7759/cureus.17450,true
075-310-577-144-83X,The barriers and challenges that hinder the quality implementation in Tripoli – Lebanon hospitals,2022,journal article,International Journal of Healthcare,Sciedu Press,,Khaled Kamaleddine; Moetaz Soubjaki; Maher Masri,"<jats:p>Quality in healthcare is achievable through quality management systems and enhances service quality, operations, and management. Health organizations that realize quality implementation have high staff satisfaction, client satisfaction, employee cooperation, and commitment from managerial to subordinate levels. However, health systems must address barriers and challenges to attaining desired quality. This study explores Tripoli hospitals’ challenges and obstacles affecting the implementation of quality management systems. It used a quantitative methodology with a semi-structured questionnaire for data collection to interview respondents comprising managerial, directorial, and administrative personnel. The hospital’s management staff consisted of nursing medical quality and general directors. Results from the semi-structured interview indicated that hospital directors in Tripoli city’s healthcare systems face barriers and challenges related to human resource management and organization structure to achieving quality using quality management systems. A total of 189 participants drawn from directorial capacities in Tripoli city’s hospitals participated in the study. Most participants (I = 115) asserted that lack of staff involvement and motivation were primary barriers to hospital quality implementation. Hypotheses 1 and 3 were proved using correlation analysis, but hypothesis 2 was statistically insignificant. The findings recommended that human resource management practices such as staff motivation, fair compensation, and involvement in decision-making are necessary for quality improvement. Furthermore, managerial professionalism and specialty are crucial for spearheading quality implementation, while robust quality policies, protocols, and systems are necessary for quality implementation in Tripoli hospitals.

Dibble; Maneet Kaur; Avonne E. Connor,"Purpose The current study examined disparities in the associations between medically vulnerable populations and healthcare-related outcomes among population-based female cancer survivors and determined if these associations differed by length of cancer survivorship. Methods One thousand eight hundred ninety-seven women with a cancer history from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2016 contributed data. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with multivariable logistic regression models to measure the associations between the predictors (race/ethnicity, poverty status, education, comorbidity status, US nativity) and outcomes (perceived health, healthcare utilization and access outcomes), overall and by length of survivorship. Results There was an average of 14.3 years (SD = 11.7; range = 2-84) since initial cancer diagnosis, with 25.1% being short-term and 74.9% being long-term survivors. Overall, racial/ethnic minority women were more likely to report poor/fair health status (OR, 2.68; 95% CI 1.73-4.15) and utilizing routine care other than a doctor's office/HMO (OR, 1.61; 95% CI 1.12-2.29) in comparison with NHW survivors. Length of survivorship significantly modified the association between race/ethnicity and odds of seeing a mental health provider in the last year (p-interaction = 0.003), with short-term minority survivors being significantly more likely (OR, 2.63; 95% CI 1.29-5.35) and long-term minority survivors being less likely (OR, 0.68; 95% CI 0.37-1.23). Conclusions Racial/ethnic disparities exist among female cancer survivors for perceived health status and certain healthcare utilization outcomes, with some differences observed by length of cancer survivorship.

While others have reported on the success of burnout-reduction strategies on practicing physicians and residents, few strategies have approached the problem longitudinally in residents. Approach From 2014 to 2019, the authors used a previously developed survey to assess factors related to resident burnout, including sleep, personal time, professional fulfillment, effects on relationships, program recognition, and peer support. At Hennepin Healthcare, a safety-net hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the authors created a reproducible process for collecting data from internal medicine residents annually, and for using evidence-based conceptual frameworks to develop a continuous improvement method to address worklife across training years. Interventions included jeopardy coverage for essential life events, a newsletter celebrating resident achievements, removal of after-hours consult pager call, an extra day off for senior residents on the wards, and care packages distributed to night teams. Outcomes Annually from 2014 to 2019, 40/66 (60.6%) to 62/73 residents (84.9%) completed the survey (average response rate was 72.1% over 6 years). Survey results were shared with residents in multiple formats, and feedback was requested, demonstrating that burnout reduction is a priority for program leadership. High professional fulfillment scores were documented every year. Self-reported rates of burnout were between 25% and 35%. Significant improvements were seen in perception of empathy, sleep impairment, and peer support. Next steps The authors developed a plan for minimizing burnout, which includes the following evidence-based domains: workload, control, balance in effort and reward, work-life balance, fairness, values, support, gender equity, moral distress, and moral injury. Additional interventions include protected time for didactics, trauma-informed care training, and addressing workplace racism. The authors aspire to achieve an integrated culture of well-being for residents and faculty; foster an efficient, effective, and fair learning environment; and reduce-and ultimately eliminate-burnout.",Burnout; Psychology; Nursing; Health care; Psychological intervention; Moral injury; Response rate (survey); Learning environment; Workload; Peer support,,"Adult; Burnout, Professional/etiology; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Minnesota; Physicians/psychology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Workload",10.1097/acm.0000000000003940,false

However, security and privacy issues impede the wide deployment of smart healthcare systems (SHS). Most of existing solutions still have drawbacks with respect to computation efficiency and users’ privacy. In this paper, a blockchain-enabled attribute-based access control scheme with hidden policies is proposed for SHS. The scheme introduces multiple authorities to avoid single point failure. Especially, the mode of online-offline encryption relieves users’ online computation burden by transferring computation tasks to the idle time of users, and policy hiding protects users’ sensitive information. Furthermore, fair payments are realized based on blockchain and smart contracts to support the outsourcing of decryption between users and mobile edge computing servers. Finally, the proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model, and experimental results show that it is computationally efficient and hence can be used in the edge computing environment.",Blockchain; Access control; Computer security; Health care; Computer science; Control (management); Business; Artificial intelligence; Economics; Economic growth,,,10.1016/j.jksuci.2022.08.015,true

Ezeome; Emmanuel Ezeome,"Background: Cataract, glaucoma, and conjunctivitis are common causes of ocular morbidity in Nigeria. A major obstacle in reducing the burden of ocular morbidity in rural areas is access to eye care services. Up to 80% of the population in developing countries use traditional medications for their primary healthcare needs because they are accessible, available, and affordable. The aim of this study is to evaluate the content and cost of commercialized traditional medications used in the treatment of common eye conditions in Nigeria. Patients and Methods: All the registered traditional healers (THs) at an International Trade Fair in Enugu who treated eye problems were identified. Data on their location and scope of their practice were collected by the researchers. Proxy patients consulted THs in the trade fair with simulated cataract, glaucoma, and bacterial conjunctivitis, and treatment was sought. Medication for the treatment of the simulated disorders was paid for and procured. The mode of administration and the cost of the drugs were recorded by proxy patients. Each medication was labeled with a code and sent to the laboratories of the National Agency for Drug Administration and Control for analysis. Data were entered into a database on Microsoft Access and transferred to STATA V12.1 (StataCorp) for analysis. Results: Cataract was treated by 87.5% of all the traditional eye healers interviewed. A total of 32 samples were collected and analyzed. These comprised mainly oral (53.1%) and topical traditional medications (43.8%). The pH of the topical samples ranged from 3.5 to 10, while the mean microbiological load per topical solution was 3.3 × 104 cfu/mL ± 0.96. The cost of treatment of cataract ranged from 4 to 70 USD. Conclusion: The content of the majority of the samples of traditional eye medications in this study had high extremes of pH and/or had a high microbial content.

This study aimed to assess the Palestinian women's knowledge about OC symptoms and determine the factors associated with having good knowledge. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2019 to March 2020 in the two main areas of Palestine: the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as the Gaza Strip. A translated-into-Arabic version of the validated OC awareness measure (OCAM) was utilized for data collection. Stratified convenience sampling was used to recruit adult women attending hospitals, primary healthcare centers, and public spaces at 11 governorates. The knowledge level was categorized into three categories based on the number of symptoms recognized: poor (0 to 4), fair (5 to 8), and good (9 to 11). Results Of 6095 approached, 5618 participants completed the Arabic OCAM (response rate = 92.1%).A total of 5411 questionnaires were included in the analysis: 2278 from the Gaza Strip and 3133 from the West Bank and Jerusalem. Participants living in the West Bank and Jerusalem were older, of higher monthly income, and with more chronic diseases than those living in the Gaza Strip. The most frequently identified symptoms were 'extreme generalized fatigue' (n = 3821, 70.6%), 'unexplained weight loss' (n = 3607, 66.7%), and 'increased abdominal size on most days' (n = 3252, 60.1%). On the other hand, the least recognized symptoms were 'feeling full persistently' (n = 1553, 28.7%) and 'difficulty eating on most days' (n = 1971, 36.4%). Only 943 participants (17.4%) displayed good knowledge of OC symptoms. Participants from the Gaza Strip had a higher likelihood than participants from the West Bank and Jerusalem to have a good level of knowledge (21.0% vs. 14.8%). Being married, knowing someone with cancer, and visiting hospitals were all associated with a higher likelihood of having good knowledge level. However, living in the West Bank and Jerusalem was associated with a lower likelihood of having good knowledge. Conclusion The overall knowledge of OC symptoms in this study was low.

No research has investigated the use of the OSCE within speech and language therapy undergraduate education. This study aimed to evaluate undergraduate speech and language therapy students' perceptions of the OSCE and to determine if perceptions differed depending on stage of undergraduate education. Methods An online survey was distributed to second- and final-year students in a 4-year undergraduate speech and language therapy university programme after completing an OSCE. Quantitative survey data were analysed descriptively and statistically using Fisher's exact tests. Thematic analysis was used to analyse narrative survey comments. Results The response rate was 80%. The students perceived the OSCE to be a fair (95%) and meaningful way (97%) of assessing clinical competencies, which provided them with greater confidence for practice (91%). The OSCE was deemed to be less stressful than a written exam (65%). No significant differences were observed between second- and fourth-year students' perceptions. Five major themes included clarity of expectations, time allocated, consistency between examiners, influence on student learning, and personal impact.

A Cross-Sectional Study",2022,journal article,Advances in Public Health,Hindawi Limited,,Wubshet Debebe Negash; Asmamaw Atnafu; Desale Bihonegn Asmamaw; Chalie Tadie Tsehay,"<jats:p>Background. An effective designation of health facilities improves the facility’s ability to respond to patients’ legitimate expectations. Limited evidence exists regarding the association between health system responsiveness and financial fairness in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Ethiopia. The purpose of the study was, therefore to evaluate the health system responsiveness among insured and uninsured outpatients in primary healthcare facilities and determine the association between health insurance and health system responsiveness among outpatients. Methods. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted between March 30 and April 30,2021. The study sampled 423 participants using a systematic random sampling technique, and the data was collected with structured and pretested questionnaires administered by interviewers. Responsiveness was measured using the short version of the World Health Organization’s multicountry responsiveness survey, which has seven dimensions including autonomy, communication, confidentiality, attention, dignity, choice, and amenities. Using quantile regression, a specific association between health insurance and the health system responsiveness index was examined, adjusting for sociodemographic, quality, and satisfaction-related factors. Results. Of a total of 417 outpatients, 70.74% had health insurance. There was no statistical difference in health system responsiveness among insured and uninsured outpatients. Possession of health insurance was not associated with responsiveness (−0.67; 95%CI: −1.59, 0.25). There was a statistically significant negative relationship between age and responsiveness (−1.33; 95% CI: −2.47, −0.19) among 30–39 year olds and (−1.66; 95% CI: −3.02, −0.32) among 40–49 year olds. However, there was a positive statistical association between responsiveness with urban residence (+1.33; 95%CI: 0.37, 2.29), perceived quality of healthcare (+2.96; 95%CI: 1.95, 4.05), and patient satisfaction (3; 95%CI: 1.94, 4.07). Conclusions. There was no difference in the responsiveness of the health system between insured and uninsured outpatients. All domains need further improvement, particularly those more closely related to patients’ concerns, such as waiting time to get service and choices of healthcare providers. Furthermore, health facility administrators and the government should enhance responsive healthcare services in parallel with quality improvement and patient satisfaction, based on feedback from service users for better performance.</jats:p>",Medicine; Health facility; Cross-sectional study; Environmental health; Health care; Family medicine; Population; Health services; Pathology; Economic growth; Economics,,,10.1155/2022/3857873,true

Bell; Melinda White; Amy Thompson; Michelle Suter; Rebecca McKechnie; Danielle Gallegos,"Children from food insecure households are more likely to have substandard food and nutritional intakes, and experience developmental delays, behaviour issues and increased use of health services. In Australia, screening for household food insecurity (HFI) within health services is not undertaken routinely, limiting opportunities to optimise nutrition and healthcare. This research aimed to (a) identify the prevalence, potential determinants and outcomes of HFI among paediatric outpatients in two Queensland hospitals; and (b) identify questions suitable for screening households at risk of HFI. A cross-sectional survey collected data from caregivers of children attending paediatric appointments at two hospitals in Brisbane, Australia (n = 148). Sociodemographic, health and household-related characteristics were collected, and food security status was assessed using four HFI measures. Chi-square, independent t-tests, ANOVA and logistic regression explored associations between HFI and health-related characteristics. A potential HFI screener was identified based on the most frequently endorsed questions from any HFI measure, and its validity was assessed through calculation of sensitivity and specificity. Prevalence of HFI was 41%, with 16% experiencing very low food security. Households with a child of ‘fair/poor’ health had 5.59 times greater odds of being food insecure than being food secure, compared to households with a child of ‘excellent/good’ health (aOR 5.59, 95% CI: 1.3–23.5). HFI was also positively associated with household chaos (p =.006). A combination of two questions was identified as a possible screening tool, with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 90%. This study demonstrated HFI may be highly prevalent in a paediatric outpatient population, which may result in difficulties in being able to follow nutrition prescriptions. A highly sensitive and specific two-question screening tool was identified and may assist practitioners in paediatric healthcare settings in identifying clients who are at risk of HFI.",Odds; Logistic regression; Health care; Medical prescription; Population; Food insecurity; Screening tool; Food security; Medicine; Environmental health,children; food insecurity; health outcomes; paediatric primary care; screening tool,Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Food Insecurity; Food Supply; Health Services; Humans; Nutritional Status,10.1111/hsc.13219,true

Since the use of routinely-collected health data has been prioritized internationally by governments and funding agencies to improve patient care, support health system planning, and facilitate epidemiological surveillance and research, high quality data is essential. The purpose of this study was to verify the accuracy of a selection of data elements that are entered in the Registry. Data quality was assessed by comparing data re-abstracted from patient records to data entered into the Ontario birth Registry. A purposive sample of 10 hospitals representative of hospitals in Ontario based on level of care, birth volume and geography was selected and a random sample of 100 linked mother and newborn charts were audited for each site. Data for 29 data elements were compared to the corresponding data entered in the Ontario birth Registry using percent agreement, kappa statistics for categorical data elements and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for continuous data elements. Agreement ranged from 56.9 to 99.8%, but 76% of the data elements (22 of 29) had greater than 90% agreement. There was almost perfect (kappa 0.81–0.99) or substantial (kappa 0.61–0.80) agreement for 12 of the categorical elements. Six elements showed fair-to-moderate agreement (kappa 0.50).

The area of personalized therapies and precision medicine has now arrived, with huge data sets not only used for experimental and research approaches, but also in the ""<i>real world</i>"". Analysis of real world data requires development of legal, procedural and technical infrastructure. The integration of all clinical data sets for any given patient is important and necessary in order to develop a patient-centered treatment approach. Data-driven research comes with its own challenges and solutions. The Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) Guiding Principles provide guidelines to make data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable to the research community. Federated learning, standards and ontologies are useful to improve robustness of artificial intelligence algorithms working on big data and to increase trust in these algorithms. When dealing with big data, the univariate statistical approach changes to multivariate statistical methods significantly shifting the potential of big data. Combining multiple omics gives previously unsuspected information and provides understanding of scientific questions, an approach which is also called the systems biology approach.

Screening to detect early sight-threatening lesions of DR can reduce the burden of vision loss; nevertheless, the process requires intensive manual labor and extensive resources to accommodate the increasing number of patients with diabetes. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been shown to be an effective tool which can potentially lower the burden of screening DR and vision loss. In this article, we review the use of AI for DR screening on color retinal photographs in different phases of application, ranging from development to deployment. Early studies of machine learning (ML)-based algorithms using feature extraction to detect DR achieved a high sensitivity but relatively lower specificity. Robust sensitivity and specificity were achieved with the application of deep learning (DL), although ML is still used in some tasks. Public datasets were utilized in retrospective validations of the developmental phases in most algorithms, which require a large number of photographs. Large prospective clinical validation studies led to the approval of DL for autonomous screening of DR although the semi-autonomous approach may be preferable in some real-world settings. There have been few reports on real-world implementations of DL for DR screening. It is possible that AI may improve some real-world indicators for eye care in DR, such as increased screening uptake and referral adherence, but this has not been proven. The challenges in deployment may include workflow issues, such as mydriasis to lower ungradable cases; technical issues, such as integration into electronic health record systems and integration into existing camera systems; ethical issues, such as data privacy and security; acceptance of personnel and patients; and health-economic issues, such as the need to conduct health economic evaluations of using AI in the context of the country. The deployment of AI for DR screening should follow the governance model for AI in healthcare which outlines four main components: fairness, transparency, trustworthiness, and accountability.",,Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Deployment; Diabetic retinopathy; Diabetic retinopathy screening; Machine learning; Retinal photographs,,10.1007/s40123-023-00691-3,true

082-488-928-213-342,Back to the OR of the Future: How Do We Make It a Good One?,2021,journal article,Anesthesiology,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),United States,Martin J. London,"The classic 1985 science fiction film Back to the Future transports the erstwhile protagonist (Marty McFly, played by a young Michael J. Fox) 30 yr backwards into the past in the eccentric “Doc” Brown’s custom DeLorean time machine to deal with a series of comedic yet moral quandaries regarding his future existence. A notable quote by Doc Brown is, “The future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one.”The future of intraoperative and perioperative anesthetic management is of course unfolding every moment, but as in our personal and social lives, seminal events tend to provide “inflection points” when changes in pace allow us to step back and take stock of what “is already there.” For the different generations, those entering anesthesia practice, in the prime of their professional careers, or leaving practice (roughly equating with Millennial, Generation X, and Baby Boomers), such inflection points are either nearly invisible or strikingly obvious. For an aging Boomer whose day would begin nearly four decades ago with my earpiece pinned to my scrub shirt and pen in hand to fill out my paper record, overjoyed that I had arrived early enough to hunt down one of the few automated blood pressure monitors available so I wouldn’t have to manually pump blood pressures myself every 5 min, such points are striking despite progressive age-related memory loss! Obvious advancements in the operating room such as routine pulse oximetry, automated blood pressure monitoring, widespread availability of ultrasound technologies, and videolaryngoscopy make providing anesthesia so much less stressful for the practitioner and safer for the patient while watching surgeons perform near miraculous forms of minimally invasive surgery guided by advanced pre- and intraoperative imaging technologies. But when it comes to actually figuring out what is going on with my patient physiologically during a case, I still often feel the same sense of “unease” I experienced as a novice trainee.Progress in advancing “interconnectedness” and application of artificial intelligence technologies in the operating room has been steadily progressing given concerted efforts by groups of “visionaries” (along with the requisite industrial collaborators) albeit perhaps at a somewhat slower pace than many of us expected. However, given the piecemeal nature of scientific progress, we are presented with an uncomfortably large number of technological paths to “the future.” For better or worse, many of us have increasingly put a fair amount of faith into clinical “black boxes,” with the processed electroencephalogram for predicting the depth of anesthesia perhaps the most pervasive example overall. In the cardiovascular arena, a plethora of noninvasive monitors of cardiac output displaying a panoply of cardiovascular parameters have been introduced and are often used for “goal directed therapy” for fluid and pressor/inotropic support despite underwhelming data for clinical effectiveness.Most recently, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved clinical software capable of predicting upcoming episodes of hypotension based on alterations in the invasive arterial waveform configuration highlighted previously in Anesthesiology.1 In this issue, the process by which another type of decision support software, Acumen Assisted Fluid Management (Edwards Lifesciences, USA), was approved is presented.2The use of artificial intelligence–derived controllers clearly signals a new era in intraoperative hemodynamic management. However, it is troubling to me that neither of these approaches has direct inputs from preoperative patient-specific or other potential anesthetic-specific parameters. Although a recent editorial professed that closed loop anesthesia is likely to be as good as the best human anesthesia,3 I have reservations that simply servo-controlling cardiovascular parameters is adequate to improve outcome and also poses challenges to maintain our specialty’s intellectual capabilities as perioperative physicians.How we are trained as perioperative physicians is grounded firmly in as best an assessment as possible of our patients’ key preoperative baseline factors, forming the basis for many for our decisions, coupled with expected stressors likely to be encountered in the operating room and pharmacologic effects of drugs. The patient with a very low ejection fraction will respond differently to all aspects of anesthetic, fluid, and pressor/inotropic management than a hyperdynamic, hypertrophic patient. A truly integrated closed loop system should have appropriate baseline preoperative factors integrated into it. For the average “normal” patient, such inputs can easily be modeled, but we must be appropriately leery of inappropriate application of “blanket” software approaches to abnormal patients. These systems depend on input of the patients’ key baseline hemodynamic values, but what is an appropriate baseline value is often controversial or, perhaps better stated, highly dynamic. The importance of surgical manipulation, with alterations of gravity (head up/down influencing venous return, side-to-side alterations that may alter a transducer’s reference point, and others), is also a necessary input. Nearly complete reliance on one particular noninvasive method for determining cardiac index (and/or stroke volume) as the major independent variable for such systems can be problematic.Another dimension to consider, one that is not unique to anesthesiology or medical practice in general, is that of “deskilling.” However, as pointed out by numerous opinion leaders over the past several decades, of greater immediacy to our daily practices is our intellectual linkage to safety issues in the aviation industry. Widespread application of that industry’s safety practices in the form of “preflight checklists” and development of sophisticated simulators has improved and continues to improve what is already an astoundingly safe industry given how many people are transported annually. However, despite these advancements, there is fear among aviation experts that pilots are losing skills at a faster rate than they are gaining them, a process facilitated by increasing automation on the flight deck. A number of air disasters or near misses over the past several decades related to malfunction or misinterpretation of flight path control systems or internal aircraft software control systems (most notably the infamous Boeing 737 MAX disasters) have been attributed to this phenomenon.It does seem inevitable that software control of hemodynamics and anesthetic depth will become routine. Thus, we might ask, “What happens to the operator/clinician involved?” Will it be more appropriate for a busy anesthesiologist covering multiple operating rooms to be supervising the admittedly extreme scenario of “information technology experts” ensuring the machines are functioning properly or actual healthcare providers monitoring the patient and not the machine? And what happens when the “computers go down”? Who will rush in to fill the gap? Will the process be “good” or will it be “dystopic”?Despite predictions of possible doom and gloom by an aging Boomer, there is abundant room for hope and daily evidence that surgical and anesthetic outcomes continue to improve. The maturation of simulation technologies holds great promise. “High-fidelity” simulation strategies are already a routine part of anesthesia training and maintenance of certification and have recently moved into the purely digital realm, allowing even wider exposure and repetition required for retention. One intriguing development is the introduction of “multidimensional decision support displays” and “avatar”-type monitoring display technology that visually integrate hemodynamic parameters more clearly display “wellness” or “danger” on the monitor screen.4,5 Although still early in development and commercial introduction, this approach promises to mirror in real time what is happening to the patient in a visually straightforward manner that should be hard to misinterpret. Of course, these depictions will only be as good as the inputs from the monitoring technologies used to estimate them, but they are a step in the right direction to facilitating close attention to the patient at hand. However, a recent report documenting improvement in a variety of “surrogate” process factors (e.g., blood pressure, tidal volume, and fluid administration) failed to document any improvement in the requisite “hard” clinical outcomes, illustrating the complexity of the challenges ahead.6 Is it possible that many physiologic parameters will be passé in the distant future when “precision medicine” is highly evolved and routine?The way forward to the operating room of the future is fraught with thousands of incremental advances. Generations of clinicians will come and go, either happy with their practice or bemoaning the excessive troubleshooting involved. Hopefully, medical educators will remain faithful to ensuring that the basic, yet admittedly imperfect, tenets of cardiovascular physiology (cardiac output, venous return, heart rate, preload, afterload, contractility) are thoroughly engrained into all care providers’ brains along with the necessary manual clinical skills honed by many hours of simulation training. With this mantra in mind, I certainly think we can fulfill Doc Brown’s advice, so let’s make it good!The author is not supported by, nor maintains any financial interest in, any commercial activity that may be associated with the topic of this article.",Cardiac output; Intensive care medicine; Preoperative care; Vasoconstrictor Agents; Venous return curve; Text mining; Medicine; Engineering ethics; Engineering,,Anesthesia/methods; Anesthesiology/instrumentation; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Operating Rooms; Perioperative Care/methods,10.1097/aln.0000000000003862,true

The population health research community has a vast experience in the reuse of data for health monitoring and surveillance or healthcare performance assessment. However, there is a gap in the extensive reuse of individual sensitive data, particularly when mobilising these data requires the linkage of multiple data sources curated in different sites. The gap is greater when it comes to using sensitive data in cross-national research. The usual arguments to explain the scarce extensive and continuous mobilisation of sensitive data are data privacy and safety issues, the difficulty to discover data sources of value, complex accessing rules, uneven data quality (particularly, non-harmonized data), and limited capacity (personnel and dedicated resources). In InfAct Joint Action, Information for Action, we demonstrated at a very small scale that mobilising individual sensitive data is possible, it is compliant with the legal and ethical requirements, and it yields the expected outputs. The instrument used for such an achievement was the design, implementation and deployment of a very small-scale federated infrastructure, where we could pilot all the legal, organisational, data quality and technological issues related to the mobilisation of individual sensitive data. (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-021-00731-z). Building on those achievements In PHIRI (see here https://www.phiri.eu/wp7) we are paving the way for a large-scale research infrastructure where multiple population health researchers with multiple research questions will need the mobilisation of multiple data sources from multiple sites across Europe. The PHIRI enhanced infrastructure will have to be prepared to provide a variety of services for data discovery, data access, data analysis and research outputs FAIR publication, while improving the capacity of population health researchers community in the use of advanced computing tools. In this workshop we will start describing the PHIRI federated research infrastructure achievements, the governance step-wise approach and the technological solutions provided. The workshop will discuss how an enhanced PHIRI could improve its services for the community of population health researchers; in particular improving the analytical capacity and the associated technological solutions.

084-336-235-154-319,"Think Global, Act Local",2022,journal article,Acta Medica Philippina,University of the Philippines Manila,Philippines,Joven Jeremius Q. Tanchuco,"<jats:p>In the Philippines, many people would think that items made in other countries have better quality and are more desirable.More recently, with numerous goods coming from nearby countries also having built their reputation for similar or even betterquality – for example, those coming from Japan, Taiwan and more lately, China – goods from these countries are now alsopopular. But it remains unusual that we would generally prefer local brands, i.e., those made in the Philippines.When it comes to using scientific evidence as basis for local medical practice, it should be argued that high quality localdata is superior and should be used. After all, it is derived from our countrymen who may have a different disease biology and/or natural history, sociocultural determinants, as well as clinical practices. It is unfortunate, however, that such local data arenot always available. Even if it exists, it is also not easily accessible.&#x0D;; In this, and other issues of Acta Medica Philippina, we see some of the efforts being made by our colleagues to look intothis local experience. They offer varied insights into how global diseases are manifested locally: are there differences that weshould be aware of?&#x0D;; As far back as 2006, the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) has already facilitatedthe creation of a National Unified Health Research Agenda (NUHRA) which is reviewed every five years to identifyresearch priorities in the Philippines.1 In its latest iteration, the 2017-2022 NUHRA prioritizes among others, the holisticapproach to health and wellness that aims to produce evidence geared towards the application and recognition of traditional,sociocultural, and alternative approaches to health.2  The study by Sanico and Medina in this issue highlights this objective.It looked into the potential health benefits and risks of an indigenous fermented rice wine called tapuy. Utilizing a modernbiotechnology technique called metagenomic sequencing, the authors found significant presence of probiotic bacteria thatcan be explored for health applications. However, they also detected the presence of harmful bacteria which may indicate theneed for possible standardization of the fermentation practices.&#x0D;; The Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has long plagued the global landscape ever since it was first describedin 1981.3  Because cases have not been described previously, AIDS with its increasing numbers, was soon labeled as anepidemic.4,5 In the Philippines, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has been a fairly more recent one.6-9 Sadly, our country is nowidentified as one with the fastest growing HIV epidemic in the Western Pacific.10 Identifying perceptions of the generalcommunity, especially the high risk populations, can go a long way in curtailing the rising numbers.11 The article by Jamesand colleagues looked further into this by evaluating the knowledge, attitudes and practices on prevention and transmission ofHIV/AIDS among college students in Pampanga, Philippines. The participants were found to have a low knowledge of HIV/AIDS, but had a good attitude toward HIV positive individuals. The authors recommended that education on HIV/AIDScould help control the local epidemic.&#x0D;; The study by Rogelio and Santiago looked into screening for retinopathy in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus(GDM). Their data did not support screening to be done in this population. A study had previously reported that GDM has aprevalence of 14% in the Philippines making GDM a disease that is worth addressing.12 On a related note, several internationalguidelines define how GDM can be diagnosed.13 The Philippine Obstetrics and Gynecology Society advocates for a one-stepapproach (a single OGTT using a 75-g anhydrous glucose load with fasting blood sugar ≥92 mg/dL, and a 2-hour level of&lt;126 mg/dL). The one-step approach may be more convenient for patients as it also needs a single visit. A recent report fromAustralia, which also follows a one-step screening process, showed at least a 25% overdiagnosis and its consequent need forfurther testing and the patient anxiety that goes with it.14 An earlier US study also showed 50% more women diagnosed withGDM using the one-step approach compared to a two-step one.15 To be fair, the US study, similar to another one done alsoin Australia, showed no significant differences in the pregnancy outcomes between the two approaches.16 Although a localstudy identified numerical differences in pregnancy outcomes (e.g., risk for primary caesarean section, large for gestational ageinfants, etc.) comparing the two criteria, these were not found to be statistically significant.13 Perhaps there is a need to lookinto this matter again using larger cohorts. As the Philippines gears up for Universal Healthcare, the outcomes of screeningfor GDM can become even more important.&#x0D;; The article by Arcilla, et al., on validation of foreign instruments to assess disease and treatment outcomes representsanother area where local data is needed.17 Such validation seeks to investigate whether an instrument developed elsewhere willlikewise yield accurate – and comparable – data for which it was intended. The BREAST-Q is a patient-reported outcomeinstrument designed to evaluate outcomes among women undergoing different types of breast surgery.18 The authors foundhigh internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and acceptability. But there was only low to moderate construct validity inthe Filipino cohort. Among other findings, the authors report respondents having difficulty in understanding some languagetranslations, and even negative reactions to some of the questions. The authors recommend further studies with a largernumber of respondents including those who have undergone nipple reconstruction. The initial results also note that it may bebetter to interpret the “sexual well-being” subscale separately because of the influence that culture may play.&#x0D;; The study of Manalili, et al. looked into hemoperfusion as an intervention for COVID-19. The authors report a highmortality and a long length of hospital stay. To put this into perspective, the period of study was from April to September 2020,early in the pandemic period when little is relatively known about the disease. Since then, we know more about COVID-19,with vaccination and anti-virals being available that could alter the disease severity. As of December 2021, local experts donot recommend the use of hemoperfusion among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 mostly because of low certainty ofevidence.19 The option to use it in COVID-19 patients with clinical deterioration despite standard medical therapy includingtocilizumab is however still suggested. The study published here would have been more interesting if there was a comparisonof the outcomes with a similar group who did not undergo hemoperfusion. But it certainly illustrates how generating localdata and local experience goes a long way in examining relevant medical practice/s in our Philippine setting.&#x0D;; Case reports help to enhance clinical knowledge by describing the profile and management of patients who have anuncommon or rare disease or may have presented atypically.20-22 We have the opportunity in this issue to share four of theserare cases. The report submitted by Terencio, et al. on the combination of COVID-19 and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS)allows us better understanding of COVID-19 and its neurologic complications. As we continue to gain more importantinformation on COVID-19, describing the possibility of GBS as a possible consequence can help clinicians anticipate additionaltreatments as in this case. The same is true for the report submitted by Ablaza and Salonga-Quimpo on abdominal dyskinesia(with its more colorful description as “belly dancer dyskinesia”).&#x0D;; Then we have the case of SOLAMEN syndrome, reported by Maceda and colleagues. This case is more dramatic in thatit presents with disfigurement of the patient. Its management is more nuanced as it requires a multidisciplinary approachto address all the affected body parts.23,24 Unfortunately, it also has a strong genetic component as well as predilection tomalignancy which would require longer-term care. Another genetic disease, X-linked dystonia parkinsonism, is likewisereported in this issue in the article by Jamora and others. It is a rare movement disorder that is highly prevalent in Panay Islandin the Philippines.25-28 All cases described so far have been linked to Filipino ancestry, suggesting a single genetic founder andgenetic homogeneity. Although extremely rare globally, the prevalence of XDP in the Philippines is 0.31 per 100,000; and inPanay Island, 5.74 per 100,000. Ninety-five percent of affected individuals are males; the average age is 44 years (20–70 years);and the average age at onset is 39 years (12–64 years).27 Cases in patients of Filipino descent have been described in othercountries.29 The report published here is of particular interest as it is the first time the procedure called Unilateral TranscranialMagnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound Pallidothalamic Tractotomy has been tried for this condition; a conditionwhich leads to significant progressive disability but no definite treatment.27&#x0D;; All of these case reports may well be the first ones in the Philippines and we have it published here in Acta MedicaPhilippina.&#x0D;; I am certain there will be many more insightful studies done locally that will be published – and had been published – inthis journal. These are testament to the recognition that even as we are able to think following the highest global standards,we are also able to act (and do studies) locally in ways that are beneficial to our own Philippine community.&#x0D;;                                                                                                                         Joven Jeremius Q.

Design Systematic review of qualitative or quantitative studies reporting data relating to referral, uptake, attendance and/or completion in pulmonary rehabilitation. Participants People aged >18years with a diagnosis of COPD and/or their healthcare professionals. Data extraction and analysis Data were extracted regarding the nature of barriers and enablers of pulmonary rehabilitation referral and participation. Extracted data items were mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Results A total of 6969 references were screened, with 48 studies included and 369 relevant items mapped to the TDF. The most frequently represented domain was ‘Environment' (33/48 included studies, 37% of mapped items), which included items such as waiting time, burden of illness, travel, transport and health system resources. Other frequently represented domains were ‘Knowledge' (18/48 studies, including items such as clinician knowledge of referral processes, patient understanding of rehabilitation content) and ‘Beliefs about consequences' (15/48 studies, including items such as beliefs regarding role and safety of exercise, expectations of rehabilitation outcomes). Barriers to referral, uptake, attendance or completion represented 71% (n=183) of items mapped to the TDF. All domains of the TDF were represented; however, items were least frequently coded to the domains of ‘Optimism' and ‘Memory'. The methodological quality of included studies was fair (mean quality score 9/12, SD 2). Conclusion Many factors – particularly those related to environment, knowledge, attitudes and behaviours – interact to influence referral, uptake, attendance and completion of pulmonary rehabilitation. Overcoming the challenges associated with the personal and/or healthcare system environment will be imperative to improving access and uptake of pulmonary rehabilitation.

086-447-566-704-682,Does spending on refugees make a difference? A cross-sectional study of the association between refugee program spending and health outcomes in 70 sites in 17 countries.,2016,journal article,Conflict and health,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,United Kingdom,Timothy M. Tan; Paul Spiegel; Christopher Haskew; P. Gregg Greenough,"Numerous simultaneous complex humanitarian emergencies strain the ability of local governments and the international community to respond, underscoring the importance of cost-effective use of limited resources. At the end of 2011, 42.5 million people were forcibly displaced, including 10.4 million refugees under the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). UNHCR spent US$1.65 billion on refugee programs in 2011. We analyze the impact of aggregate-level UNHCR spending on mortality of refugee populations. Using 2011 budget data, we calculated purchasing power parity adjusted spending, disaggregated by population planning groups (PPGs) and UNHCR Results Framework objectives. Monthly mortality reported to UNHCR’s Health Information System from 2011 to 2012 was used to calculate crude (CMR) and under-5 (U5MR) mortality rates, and expressed as ratios to country of asylum mortality. Log-linear regressions were performed to assess correlation between spending and mortality. Mortality data for 70 refugee sites representing 1.6 million refugees in 17 countries were matched to 20 PPGs. Median 2011 spending was $623.27 per person (constant 2011 US$). Median CMR was 2.4 deaths per 1,000 persons per year; median U5MR was 18.1 under-5 deaths per 1,000 live births per year. CMR was negatively correlated with total spending (p = 0.027), and spending for fair protection processes and documentation (p = 0.005), external relations (p = 0.034), logistics and operations support (p = 0.007), and for healthcare (p = 0.046). U5MR ratio was negatively correlated with total spending (p = 0.015), and spending for favorable protection environment (p = 0.024), fair protection processes and documentation (p = 0.003), basic needs and essential services (p = 0.027), and within basic needs, for healthcare services (p = 0.007). Increased UNHCR spending on refugee populations is correlated with lower mortality, likely reflecting unique refugee vulnerabilities and dependence on aid. Future analyses using more granular data can further elucidate the health impact of humanitarian sector spending, thereby guiding policy choices.",Public health; Internally displaced person; Health care; Refugee; Mortality rate; Basic needs; Health services research; Population; Medicine; Environmental health,Health information system; Health spending; Mortality; Refugees,,10.1186/s13031-016-0095-4,true

Under its global action plan, the World Health Organization has envisaged tackling the AMR threat through promotion of rational antibiotic use among prescribers. Given the lack of consensus definitions and other associated challenges, we sought to devise and validate an Antimicrobial Rationality Assessment Tool-AmRAT-for standardizing the assessment of appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing. A consensus algorithm was developed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of intensivists, internal medicine practitioners, clinical pharmacologists, and infectious disease experts. The tool was piloted by 10 raters belonging to three groups of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) personnel: Master of Pharmacology (M.Sc.) (n = 3, group A), Doctor of Medicine (MD) residents (n = 3, group B), and DM residents in clinical pharmacology (n = 4, group C) using retrospective patient data from 30 audit and feedback forms collected as part of an existing AMS program. Percentage agreement and the kappa (κ) coefficients were used to measure inter-rater agreements amongst themselves and with expert opinion. Sensitivity and specificity estimates were analyzed comparing their assessments against the gold standard. For the overall assessment of rationality, the mean percent agreement with experts was 76.7% for group A, 68.9% for group B, and 77.5% for group C. The kappa values indicated moderate agreement for all raters in group A (κ 0.47-0.57), and fair to moderate in group B (κ 0.22-0.46) as well as group C (κ 0.37-0.60).

089-261-487-134-099,PREFACE,2021,journal article,History of science and technology,State University of Infrastructure and Technologies,,Oleh Pylypchuk; Oleh Strelko; Yuliia Berdnychenko,"<jats:p>In the new issue, our scientific journal offers you thirteen scientific articles. As always, we try to offer a wide variety of topics and areas and follow current trends in the history of science and technology.; ; In the article by Olha Chumachenko, оn the basis of a wide base of sources, the article highlights and analyzes the development of research work of aircraft engine companies in Zaporizhzhia during the 1970s. The existence of a single system of functioning of the Zaporizhzhia production association “Motorobudivnyk” (now the Public Joint Stock Company “Motor Sich”) and the Zaporizhzhia Machine-Building Design Bureau “Progress” (now the State Enterprise “Ivchenko – Progress”) has been taken into account.; ; Leonid Griffen and Nadiia Ryzheva present their vision of the essence of technology as a socio-historical phenomenon. The article reveals the authors' vision of the essence of the technology as a sociohistorical phenomenon. It is based on the idea that technology is not only a set of technical devices but a segment of the general system – a society – located between a social medium and its natural surroundings in the form of a peculiar social technosphere, which simultaneously separates and connects them.; ; Definitely the article by Denis Kislov, which examines the period from the end of the XVII century to the beginning of the XIX century, is also of interest, when on the basis of deep philosophical concepts, a new vision of the development of statehood and human values raised. At this time, a certain re-thinking of the management and communication ideas of Antiquity and the Renaissance took place, which outlined the main promising trends in the statehood evolution, which to one degree or another were embodied in practice in the 19th and 20th centuries. A systematic approach and a comparative analysis of the causes and consequences of those years’ achievements for the present and the immediate future of the 21st century served as the methodological basis for a comprehensive review of the studies of that period.; ; The article by Serhii Paliienko is devoted to an exploration of archaeological theory issues at the Institute of archaeology AS UkrSSR in the 1960s. This period is one of the worst studied in the history of Soviet archaeology. But it was the time when in the USSR archaeological researches reached the summit, quantitative methods and methods of natural sciences were applied and interest in theoretical issues had grown in archaeology. Now there are a lot of publications dedicated to theoretical discussions between archaeologists from Leningrad but the same researches about Kyiv scholars are still unknown; ; The legacy of St. Luke in medical science, authors from Greece - this study aims to highlight key elements of the life of Valentyn Feliksovych Voino-Yasenetskyi and his scientific contribution to medicine.; ; Among the scientists of European greatness, who at the turn of the XIX and XX centuries showed interest to the folklore of Galicia (Halychyna) and Galician Ukrainians, contributed to their national and cultural revival, one of the leading places is occupied by the outstanding Ukrainian scientist Ivan Verkhratskyi. He was both naturalist and philologist, as well as folklorist and ethnographer, organizer of scientific work, publisher and popularizer of Ukrainian literature, translator, publicist and famous public figure. I. H. Verkhratskyi was also an outstanding researcher of plants and animals of Eastern Galicia, a connoisseur of insects, especially butterflies, the author of the first school textbooks on natural science written in Ukrainian.; ; A new emerging field that has seen the application of the drone technology is the healthcare sector. Over the years, the health sector has increasingly relied on the device for timely transportation of essential articles across the globe. Since its introduction in health, scholars have attempted to address the impact of drones on healthcare across Africa and the world at large. Among other things, it has been reported by scholars that the device has the ability to overcome the menace of weather constraints, inadequate personnel and inaccessible roads within the healthcare sector. This notwithstanding, data on drones and drone application in Ghana and her healthcare sector in particular appears to be little within the drone literature. Also, little attempt has been made by scholars to highlight the use of drones in African countries. By using a narrative review approach, the current study attempts to address the gap above. By this approach, a thorough literature search was performed to locate and assess scientific materials involving the application of drones in the military field and in the medical systems of Africans and Ghanaians in particular.; ; The paper by Artemii Bernatskyi and Vladyslav Khaskin is devoted to the analysis of the history of the laser creation as one of the greatest technical inventions of the 20th century. This paper focuses on establishing a relation between the periodization of the stages of creation and implementation of certain types of lasers, with their influence on the invention of certain types of equipment and industrial technologies for processing the materials, the development of certain branches of the economy, and scientific-technological progress as a whole. The paper discusses the stages of: invention of the first laser; creation of the first commercial lasers; development of the first applications of lasers in industrial technologies for processing the materials. Special attention is paid to the “patent wars” that accompanied different stages of the creation of lasers. A comparative analysis of the market development for laser technology from the stage of creation to the present has been carried out.; ; Nineteenth-century world exhibitions were platforms to demonstrate technical and technological changes that witnessed the modernization and industrialization of the world. World exhibitions have contributed to the promotion of new inventions and the popularization of already known, as well as the emergence of art objects of world importance. One of the most important world events at the turn of the century was the 1900 World's Fair in Paris. Thus, the author has tried to analyze the participation of representatives of the sugar industry in the World's Fair in 1900 and to define the role of exhibitions as indicators of economic development, to show the importance and influence of private entrepreneurs, especially from Ukraine, on the sugar industry and international contacts.; ; The article by Viktor Verhunov highlights the life and creative path of the outstanding domestic scientist, theorist, methodologist and practitioner of agricultural engineering K. G. Schindler, associated with the formation of agricultural mechanics in Ukraine. The methodological foundation of the research is the principles of historicism, scientific nature and objectivity in reproducing the phenomena of the past based on the complex use of general scientific, special, interdisciplinary methods. For the first time a number of documents from Russian and Ukrainian archives, which reflect some facts of the professional biography of the scientist, were introduced into scientific circulation.; ; The authors from Kremenchuk National University named after Mykhailo Ostrohradskyi presented a fascinating study of a bayonet fragment with severe damages of metal found in the city Kremenchuk (Ukraine) in one of the canals on the outskirts of the city, near the Dnipro River. Theoretical research to study blade weapons of the World War I period and the typology of the bayonets of that period, which made it possible to put forward an assumption about the possible identification of the object as a modified bayonet to the Mauser rifle has been carried out. Metal science expert examination was based on X-ray fluorescence spectrometry to determine the concentration of elements in the sample from the cleaned part of the blade.; ; In the article by Mykola Ruban and Vadym Ponomarenko on the basis of the complex analysis of sources and scientific literature the attempt to investigate historical circumstances of development and construction of shunting electric locomotives at the Dnipropetrovsk electric locomotive plant has been made.; ; The next scientific article continues the series of publications devoted to the assessment of activities of the heads of the Ministry of Railways of the Russian Empire. In this article, the authors have attempted to systematize and analyze historical data on the activities of Klavdii Semyonovych Nemeshaev as the Minister of Railways of the Russian Empire. The article also assesses the development and construction of railway network in the Russian Empire during Nemeshaev's office, in particular, of the Amur Line and Moscow Encircle Railway, as well as the increase in the capacity of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The article discusses K. S. Nemeshaev's contribution to the development of technology and the introduction of a new type of freight steam locomotive for state-owned railways.; ; We hope that everyone will find interesting useful information in the new issue. And, of course, we welcome your new submissions.</jats:p>",Philosophy,,,10.32703/2415-7422-2021-11-1-7-9,true

The present study seeks to measure the household financial contribution to healthcare expenditures in Sistan-Baluchistan Province after the implementation of HTP. Methods A household survey was conducted in 2017 in Sistan-Baluchistan Province. The province is the most remote and poorest in the country and this poverty has extended to most of its main health indicators as well. About 2400 households were selected as the study samples using multistage sampling. Data were collected using the World Health Survey questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed by WHO in 2003 for assessing health system performance. Two main indicators of equity in health were measured: the percentage of households facing catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and the Fair Financial Contribution Index (FFCI). The multiple adjusted logistic regression model was used to study the likelihood of facing CHE and to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (OR) using the model coefficients. Data were then analyzed the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Results The results showed that 484 (20.2%) of the households faced CHE after implementation of the HTP. The FFCI was approximately 0.7 across the province. Statistically significant relationships were observed between the chances of facing CHE and variables including place of residence (p=0.010), having members aged more than 65 years (p=0.005) and having members with disabilities and in need of care (p=0.001). There were statistically significant relationships between the chance of facing CHE and variables related to the use of health services, including the use of dental (OR=5.212), rehabilitation (OR=2.471), diagnostic and laboratory (OR=3.637), and inpatient (OR=2.511) services. Conclusion Despite the implementation of HTP, a high percentage of the households faced CHE. The authorities should pay more attention to low-income and remote regions of the country; in addition, the HTP should financially cover outpatient healthcare services in an adequate manner.",Finance; Health indicator; Multistage sampling; Logistic regression; Health care; Poverty; Geography; Residence; Equity (finance); Index (economics),Fair Financial Contribution Index;  Iran;  household financial contribution; catastrophic healthcare expenditure,Adult; Aged; Catastrophic Illness/economics; Family Characteristics; Female; Health Expenditures/statistics & numerical data; Health Planning/economics; Health Services/economics; Health Surveys; Humans; Iran; Male; Middle Aged; Poverty; Rural Population,10.22605/rrh5495,true

090-253-178-025-580,Clinicopathological Correlation of Non Oncological Hysterectomies at a Tertiary Healthcare Centre,2022,journal article,NATIONAL JOURNAL OF LABORATORY MEDICINE,JCDR Research and Publications,,Kalpana Sharma,"<jats:p>Introduction: Hysterectomy is a common surgical procedure for benign gynaecologic pathologies despite the availability of conservative treatment options. However, studies indicate many health and psychosexual complications following this procedure. Regular histopathological audit of hysterectomies in relation to the clinical rationale will provide valuable data and insight and thus, lead to improved knowledge and expertise.  AIM: To correlate clinical and histopathological diagnosis in hysterectomies for non oncological indications and assess the agreement between the two modalities.  Materials and Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study with comparative clinicopathological analysis which included 702 hysterectomies for non oncological indications during a one-year period (April 2019 to March 2020) was carried out in the Department of Pathology at a tertiary healthcare centre in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India. Cohen-kappa value was determined to measure the degree of agreement between clinical and histopathological diagnosis. A comparative clinicopathological analysis was done by segregating cases into two categories-those with structural pathologies and the other with non structural/functional pathologies.  Results: A total of 702 hysterectomy specimens were studied. The clinicopathological concordance for structural lesions was better than functional aetiologies (87.52% vs 57.8%). Leiomyoma (AUB-L) was the most frequent clinical and histopathological diagnosis. Histopathology revealed more structural lesions than clinically suspected (81.2% vs 75.36%). The Cohen-kappa value revealed an overall fair agreement between clinical and histopathological judgement (K=0.27). Clinicopathological- agreement was lower in adenomyosis, dual structural pathologies while it was better for polyps, leiomyomas, obstetric pathologies and procidentia.  Conclusion: Although, an overall fair degree of agreement was found between clinical and histopathological diagnosis, conditions that lack a specific clinical presentation or a sensitive diagnostic test like adenomyosis showed poor clinicopathological agreement. Histopathology is a vital tool to verify the appropriateness of the clinical indication of hysterectomies. Frequent clinicopathological correlation helps in improving knowledge and expertise of the healthcare provider, thus improving future clinical judgements.</jats:p>",Medicine; Hysterectomy; Histopathology; Concordance; Adenomyosis; Retrospective cohort study; Histopathological examination; Radiology; General surgery; Gynecology; Surgery; Endometriosis; Pathology; Internal medicine,,,10.7860/njlm/2022/54846.2643,true

Hill,"Abstract Background At present there is no core outcome set (COS) for use in community and primary care Musculoskeletal (MSK) services across the UK. Services are therefore collecting different MSK outcomes and metrics in different ways and at different times. Standardising MSK data collection is essential in order for fair and impactful benchmarking to improve the quality of care delivered to the millions of patients presenting each year with MSK disorders. Objective To gain consensus on a proposed set of metrics that could be used to develop a COS for use in routine practice in community and primary care MSK services in the UK and to make recommendations to inform a future national MSK audit. Methods A consensus process involving researchers, healthcare professionals and patients. Previous research generated an initial list of proposed metrics. This proposal was then taken to wider stakeholder consensus via an online survey designed for both healthcare professionals and MSK service users. Results 199 respondents completed the survey, 166 healthcare professionals and 33 service users (25/33 eligible to answer all items within the survey). Metrics that reached strong consensus were; age, pain site, comorbidities, duration of symptoms, work status, work absence, work absence duration. No Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) met strong consensus and all Patient Reported Experience Measures (PREMs) other than timeliness/convenience met strong consensus criteria. Conclusion 7 baseline factors and 9 PREM domains reached strong consensus. The MSK-HQ PROM was the highest rated outcome measure so was also recommended for inclusion in an MSK COS.",Data collection; Inclusion (education); Audit; Stakeholder; Prom; Patient-reported outcome; Family medicine; Duration (project management); Medicine; Benchmarking,Benchmarking; Metrics; Outcome measures,"Consensus; Humans; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Primary Health Care; Surveys and Questionnaires",10.1016/j.msksp.2021.102415,false

Batarseh; Pei Wang; Nitish Gorentala,"State of the art Artificial Intelligence Assurance (AIA) methods validate AI systems based on predefined goals and standards, are applied within a given domain, and are designed for a specific AI algorithm. Existing works do not provide information on assuring subjective AI goals such as fairness and trustworthiness. Other assurance goals are frequently required in an intelligent deployment, including explainability, safety, and security. Accordingly, issues such as value loading, generalization, context, and scalability arise; however, achieving multiple assurance goals without major trade-offs is generally deemed an unattainable task. In this manuscript, we present two AIA pipelines that are model-agnostic, independent of the domain (such as: healthcare, energy, banking), and provide scores for AIA goals including explainability, safety, and security. The two pipelines: Adversarial Logging Scoring Pipeline (ALSP) and Requirements Feedback Scoring Pipeline (RFSP) are scalable and tested with multiple use cases, such as a water distribution network and a telecommunications network, to illustrate their benefits. ALSP optimizes models using a game theory approach and it also logs and scores the actions of an AI model to detect adversarial inputs, and assures the datasets used for training. RFSP identifies the best hyper-parameters using a Bayesian approach and provides assurance scores for subjective goals such as ethical AI using user inputs and statistical assurance measures. Each pipeline has three algorithms that enforce the final assurance scores and other outcomes. Unlike ALSP (which is a parallel process), RFSP is user-driven and its actions are sequential. Data are collected for experimentation; the results of both pipelines are presented and contrasted.",Computer science; Scalability; Pipeline (software); Context (archaeology); Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Domain (mathematical analysis); Software deployment; Pipeline transport; Task (project management); Adversarial system; Computer security; Database; Software engineering; Systems engineering; Engineering; Paleontology; Mathematical analysis; Mathematics; Environmental engineering; Biology; Programming language,,,10.1109/stc55697.2022.00011,false

This study aimed to describe clinical manifestations of chlorine gas exposure to identify factors leading to facility admission and the need for ICU/intubation in conflict-affected areas with limited healthcare infrastructure. Methods We conducted a case-series study, using medical records of suspected chlorine-exposed patients presenting at Kafr Zita Hospital on either 11 April or 22 May 2014. Data on age, sex, initial clinical presentation, therapeutic management, and outcome were compared by hospital admission/non-admission and attack date. All patients provided verbal informed consent. Results Fifteen patients with signs of chlorine gas exposure had detailed medical records. The mean age was 25.7 years (range 2-59), eight were male (53%), and three (20%) were under age 16. At initial presentation, all experienced respiratory distress, due to severe airway inflammation confirmed by nonspecific pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, and similar intestinal, neurological, dermatological, ophthalmological, and psychological signs and symptoms. Acute management consisted of oxygen and bronchodilators for all patients, hydrocortisone (93%), antiemetics (80%), and dexamethasone (13%). Seven (47%) made a rapid symptomatic recovery and were discharged the same day and eight (53%) were admitted for a median of two days (range 1-6 days), one of whom required intubation and later died. The only significant associations found were higher mean pulse rate (i.e. 138 versus 124; p=0.043) and body temperature (37.0 versus 36.5; p=0.019) among admitted patients compared to non-admitted.

This study aimed at investigating the effects of targeted subsidy plan (since 2010) on equality in health-care financing in Iran from 2004 to 2014.; ; MATERIALS AND METHODS; ; This was a descriptive-analysis, cross-sectional study that was conducted using data obtained from households' expenditure-income survey that is performed every year by the Statistical Center of Iran. The Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient, and Theil index were applied to measure inequality in healthcare expenditures (HEs). Furthermore, the Kakwani index was used to examine inequality in health-care finance during the study period. The analysis was performed using Stata version 13.; ; RESULTS; ; Kakwani index was negative for all the studied years, except 2007. The value of this index was equal to -0.032, -0.045, and -0.046 in 2004, 2008, and 2014 for rural areas and was equal to -0.041, -0.029, and -0.0001 for urban areas, respectively. Despite the Kakwani index has been negative for most of the years, which reflects regressive financing in health care, there is no significant change in the trend of this indicator after the implementation of the subsidies. In addition, this indicator is moving toward being positive (progressive) in urban areas in 2014, which represents increased share of the poor in health payments.; ; CONCLUSIONS; ; According to the results, the targeted subsidy plan could not reach to its purpose in health-care system for supporting the poor from HEs.

Patient prioritization refers to the process of ranking referrals in a certain order based on various criteria with the aim of improving fairness and equity in the delivery of care. Despite the widespread use of patient prioritization tools (PPTs) in healthcare services, the existing literature on this subject has mainly focused on emergency settings. Evidence has not been synthesized with respect to all the non-emergency services. This review aims to perform a systematic synthesis of published evidence concerning (1) prioritization tools’ characteristics, (2) their metrological properties, and (3) their effect measures across non-emergency services. Five electronic databases will be searched (Cochrane Library, Ovid/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL). Eligibility criteria guiding data selection will be (1) qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods empirical studies; (2) patient prioritization in any non-emergency setting; and (3) discussing characteristic, metrological properties, or effect measures. Data will be sought to report tool’s format, description, population, setting, purpose, criteria, developer, metrological properties, and outcome measures. Two reviewers will independently screen, select, and extract data. Data will be synthesized with sequential exploratory design method. We will use the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) to assess the quality of articles included in the review. This systematic review will provide much-needed knowledge regarding patient prioritization tools. The results will benefit clinicians, decision-makers, and researchers by giving them a better understanding of the methods used to prioritize patients in clinical settings.

Design Cross-sectional study. Methods From October 2019 to June 2020, 137 patient-caregiver dyads were enrolled. Sociodemographic information, the distress thermometer (including the problem list), the Distress Disclosure Index and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale were used to collect data. Data were analysed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), kappa statistics, two related samples test, chi-square tests and/or Fisher's exact tests and binary logistic regression. Results Overall, fair agreement was identified between patients' and caregivers' reports (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICC] = .528). Patients reported significantly higher psychological distress scores than paired caregiver reports. Lower psychological distress concordance was found among patients with comorbidities (odds ratio [OR], 0.352; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.155-0.798) and lower levels of self-disclosure (OR, 0.402; 95% CI, 0.186-0.868). Conclusion There was relatively low concordance between patients' reports and caregivers' perceptions of psychological distress. Family caregivers tended to underestimate patients' psychological distress. A comorbid condition and lower levels of self-disclosure contributed to this bias. Impact Having an awareness of the incongruence between patient and caregiver may help healthcare providers better interpret caregiver assessments. Healthcare providers should reinforce patient-caregiver dyadic psychosocial education to improve concordance.

A health system should be evaluated against these objectives. Monitoring equity within a health system - an equitable distribution of healthcare use and of payments for healthcare - is a core component of a health system performance assessment. We use the horizontal equity principle to evaluate equity in healthcare use in Belgium. Unfair inequality in healthcare use is measured by the fairness gap, comparing actual use and expected use corrected for needs. The empirical analysis was conducted using a linked dataset which contains data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) and administrative data. Two sets of results are reported for a selected set of indicators of use: the deviation between the average fairness gap in the population and the average fairness gap in a subgroup of interest and an assessment of systematic socioeconomic inequity in the fairness gap using the absolute concentration index. We show that important socioeconomic inequities in healthcare use exist. Inequities differ by type of care, e.g., the use of hospital care and medications is more equitable than the use of GP, outpatient specialist and dental care. When accounting for healthcare needs, we find that use among high-income groups and individuals with a high educational attainment is higher compared to financially vulnerable groups (individuals at risk of poverty or with severe material deprivation, unemployed, singles). Also, individuals who are entitled to an increased reimbursement of healthcare costs, show a lower use of outpatient specialist care than expected based on their care needs. On the other hand, increased reimbursement is effective in improving accessibility to GP care, while for other financially vulnerable individuals we find a lower use of GP care.</jats:p>",Health care; Equity (law); Health equity; Poverty; Business; Socioeconomic status; Public economics; European union; Population; Actuarial science; Environmental health; Medicine; Economic growth; Economics; Political science; Law; Economic policy,,,10.1093/eurpub/ckac129.244,true

The study will determine the potential factors, that may improve communication between parents/carers and the healthcare service providers, during the stay of their new-born babies at the Neonatal intensive care unit. <h3>Methods</h3> <h3>Methodology</h3> A Parent’s experience survey Questionnaire was prepared to determine the objectives of the study. The questionnaire included various domains including ‘interaction with doctors and nurses’, ‘knowledge and information sharing’, ‘active care and pro breast-feeding strategies’, ‘empowered decision making’, ‘co-ordinated discharge planning’, and ‘trust and confidence in doctors and nurses. The relevant domains were answered as ‘YES or ‘NO’ with a further grading on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is poor, 2 is Fair, 3 is good, 4 is very good and 5 is excellent. The questionnaire included a separate section for comments to provide any additional information, deeming necessary to improve communication. The paper-based questionnaire was completed by the parents/carers at the time of discharge by themselves, or via a telephone call where the healthcare service provider read the questionnaire for the parents/carers while noting their answers accordingly, or by reading the questionnaire to the parents/carers in a face-to-face session. The eligible study population included the neonates admitted in NICU from the period of July to October 2021 and their parents who were randomly selected. An informed consent was taken prior to be included in the study. A total of 30 questionnaires were collected. The collected data was gathered on an excel sheet and results were formulated via the same. <h3>Results</h3> On evaluation of results we found, 90% responded excellent for trust and confidence with doctors and nurses, 93% responded excellent for coordinated discharge planning, 70% responded excellent for knowledge, information sharing and interaction with health care providers, 60% responded excellent and 17% responded good for empowered decision making.53% responded excellent 10% good for active care, 53% responded excellent and 11% responded fair for privacy for breast feeding. Some innovative thoughts and positive comments were noted from parents. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Our study concluded that most of the domains in communication were practiced appropriately in our unit predominantly for trust, knowledge information sharing and coordinated discharge plans. However, implementation of better facilities is required to improve privacy for breast feeding. Continuous medical education should be provided for all the staff members to enhance our communication skills while addressing the emotional and sensitive feelings of stressful parents of sick new-born babies. The feedback from parents will help improve the family centred care in neonatal units.",Neonatal intensive care unit; Health care; Nursing; Grading (engineering); Unit (ring theory); Quality (philosophy); Service (business); Questionnaire; Scale (ratio); Psychology; Medicine; Business; Pediatrics; Social science; Philosophy; Civil engineering; Mathematics education; Physics; Epistemology; Marketing; Quantum mechanics; Sociology; Engineering; Economics; Economic growth,,,10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.705,true

Objectives: This study aimed to measure the financial protection and determinants of catastrophic health expenditures (CHEs) for cancer treatment in Shahid Rahimi Hospital, Khorramabad, located in western Iran. Methods: This study was conducted on 220 households of cancer patients in Lorestan Province, Iran. The framework of data collection was based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Survey. Interviews were conducted with individuals who met the inclusion criteria of this study; they were selected using a simple random sampling method. Data were analyzed using Chi-square test in STATA. Results: The present results showed that the incidence of CHEs and the fair financial contribution index (FFCI) were 70% and 86%, respectively. There was a significant relationship between the household CHEs and variables, such as supplementary insurance coverage, household income status, educational level of the household head, household size, age of the household head, type of cancer, and type of cancer treatment. Conclusions: More financial protection should be provided for the families of cancer patients due to the high incidence of CHEs and unfair financing of cancer care services. Moreover, healthcare systems should consider supportive policies for cancer patients and their household members by increasing the insurance coverage and expanding service packages to reduce cancer treatment expenditures.</jats:p>",Cross-sectional study; Health care; Payment; Business; Shahid; Cross-sectional data; Household income; Finance; Medicine; Environmental health; Economic growth; Economics; Geography; Philosophy; Theology; Archaeology; Pathology; Econometrics,,,10.5812/jhealthscope-119827,true

097-295-720-655-882,Towards an appropriate ethics framework for Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS): learning from issues faced in diverse HDSS in sub-Saharan Africa.,2021,journal article,BMJ global health,BMJ,England,Alex Nginyo Hinga; Sassy Molyneux; Vicki Marsh,"Introduction Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) collect data on births, deaths and migration from relatively small, geographically defined populations primarily in Africa and Asia. HDSS occupy a grey area between research, healthcare and public health practice and it is unclear how ethics guidance that rely on a research-practice distinction apply to HDSS. This topic has received little attention in the literature. In this paper, based on empirical research across sub-Saharan Africa, we map out key ethical issues for HDSS and assess the relevance of current ethics guidance in relation to these findings. Methods We conducted a qualitative study across seven HDSS sites in sub-Saharan Africa, including individual in-depth interviews and informal discussions with 68 research staff, document reviews and non-participant observations of surveillance activities. Qualitative data analysis drew on a framework approach led by a priori and emergent themes, drawing on the wider ethics and social science literature. Results There were diverse views on core ethical issues in HDSS, including regarding the strengths and challenges of community engagement, informed consent and data sharing processes. A key emerging issue was unfairness in the overall balance of benefits and burdens for residents and front-line staff when compared with other stakeholders, particularly given the socioeconomic contexts in which HDSS are generally conducted. Conclusion We argue that HDSS operate as non-traditional epidemiologic research projects but are often governed using ethics guidance developed for traditional forms of health research. There is a need for specific ethics guidance for HDSS which prioritises considerations around fairness, cost-effectiveness, ancillary care responsibilities, longitudinality and obligations of the global community to HDSS residents.",Empirical research; Public health; Sociology; Socioeconomic status; Health care; Qualitative research; Community engagement; Data sharing; Public relations; Informed consent,epidemiology; health systems; public health; qualitative study,Africa South of the Sahara/epidemiology; Demography; Humans; Information Dissemination; Informed Consent; Qualitative Research,10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004008,true

Abah,"<jats:p>Hepatitis B and C viral infections are amongst the most critical occupation-related infections in the hospital workplace. This study assesses the determinants of uptake and completion of hepatitis B vaccine amongst health care personnel (HCP) in a tertiary health facility in South-South, Nigeria. This study employs a descriptive cross-sectional study design, and data were collected using a quantitative method. Pre-tested, semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaires were administered to 280 HCP. The IBM SPSS version 21.0 was used for data analysis. About half of HCP had received the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, with less than half of that number completing the third dose. It is significantly higher amongst the core healthcare professionals than the non-healthcare professionals. There is a high drop-out rate in the hepatitis B vaccination process which was more amongst the non-clinical group than the clinical. The short duration of work (1-5 years) is a significant predictor of initiation of the vaccination process, while good knowledge of hepatitis B and C viruses was a strong predictor for complete uptake. This study reveals a fair uptake of the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine amongst HCP with a high drop-out rate and a concomitant low completion of the vaccine course amongst respondents. Priority should be given to ensure planned programmes that will help enhance optimal uptake of hepatitis B vaccine amongst HCP.</jats:p>",Medicine; Vaccination; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B vaccine; Family medicine; Health care; Interview; Drop out; Hepatitis C; Hepatitis; Internal medicine; Hepatitis B virus; Immunology; HBsAg; Virus; Demographic economics; Political science; Economics; Law; Economic growth,,,10.13005/bbra/2985,true

To make this possible, however, it is necessary that all groups of people are considered. Contexts of informal settlements and populations such as the homeless and migrants are often forgotten by vaccination campaigns. In this study, carried out as a result of a collaboration with MEDU, a non-profit association aimed at bringing healthcare to vulnerable populations, we provide important data related to the vaccination campaign carried out in the informal settlements of Rome. The objectives of this work are to (1) evaluate vaccination coverage in these contexts, (2) assess the gap with the vaccination coverage of the Italian population and try to hypothesize the causes, and (3) provide recommendations for how humanitarian associations can respond to reduce this gap. We observed important differences in vaccination coverage depending on the type of settlement. The percentage of vaccinated people in these contexts at the beginning of October range between 14.4% and 55.5%, underlining an important gap with the vaccination rate of Italy's population, which is close to 80%. The data also show that particular attention must be paid to the transiting and irregular people as they are more at risk for a lack of access to vaccination. With this study, in which we provide recommendations that integrate MEDU's fieldwork experience with the advice of the <i>Framework</i> report, we hope we can help those who work in similar contexts, to carry out a fair and effective vaccination campaign.",Vaccination; Pandemic; Human settlement; Population; Settlement (finance); Health care; Informal settlements; Work (physics); Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Environmental health; Economic growth; Geography; Medicine; Business; Virology; Economics; Engineering; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Disease; Mechanical engineering; Archaeology; Pathology; Finance; Payment,COVID-19 vaccine; homeless; migrants; public health; vaccination campaign,COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Pandemics/prevention & control; Rome/epidemiology; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination,10.3390/ijerph19020719,true

This policy was intended to improve effectiveness by decreasing unnecessary hospitalizations, and improve fairness by including risk-adjustment in setting hospital performance scores. Methods : We applied a systematic approach to assess the impact of the new policy on hospital performance. The main impact measure was a national casemix index, calculated across 2011-2016 using medical discharge and surgical procedure codes. A single-group interrupted time series analysis model with Newey ordinary least squares regression was estimated, including adjustment for seasonality, and stratified by case type. Code-level analysis was used to attribute and explain changes in casemix index due to specific diagnoses and procedures. Results : Our final model included 1,353,025 cases across 146 hospitals with a post-intervention lag-time of two months and seasonality adjustment. Among medical cases the intervention resulted in a positive casemix index trend of 0.11% per month (coefficient 0.002, CI 0.001-0.003), and a level increase of 2.25% (coefficient 0.022, CI 0.005-0.039). Trend changes were attributed to decreased cases of diarrhea and gastroenteritis, abdominal and pelvic pain, essential hypertension and fever of unknown origin. A shift from medium to short-stay cases for specific diagnoses was also detected. Level changes were attributed to improved coding practices, particularly for breast cancer, leukemia and chemotherapy. No impact on surgical casemix index was found. Conclusions : The 2014 policy resulted in increased healthcare effectiveness, by increasing the casemix index of hospitals contracted by the Ministry. This increase was mainly attributed to decreased unnecessary hospitalizations and was accompanied by improved medical discharge coding practices. Integration of pay-for-performance within a healthcare system may contribute to improving effectiveness.

As a result, the use of digital technologies for epidemic surveillance showed great potential to collect vast volumes of data, and thereby respond more effectively to the healthcare challenges. However, the deployment of these technologies raised legitimate concerns over risks to individual privacy. While the ethical and governance debate focused primarily on these concerns, other relevant issues remained in the shadows. Leveraging examples from the COVID-19 pandemic, this perspective article aims to investigate these overlooked issues and their ethical implications. Accordingly, we explore the problem of the digital divide, the role played by tech companies in the public health domain and their power dynamics with the government and public research sector, and the re-use of personal data, especially in the absence of adequate public involvement. Even if individual privacy is ensured, failure to properly engage with these other issues will result in digital epidemiology tools that undermine equity, fairness, public trust, just distribution of benefits, autonomy, and minimization of group harm. On the contrary, a better understanding of these issues, a broader ethical and data governance approach, and meaningful public engagement will encourage adoption of these technologies and the use of personal data for public health research, thus increasing their power to tackle epidemics.",Data governance; Public health; Public relations; Information privacy; Corporate governance; Government (linguistics); Shadow (psychology); Internet privacy; Harm; Business; Pandemic; Political science; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Medicine; Psychology; Law; Computer science; Marketing; Philosophy; Psychotherapist; Metric (unit); Linguistics; Data quality; Nursing; Finance; Pathology; Disease; Infectious disease (medical specialty),Big data; COVID-19; Digital epidemiology; Ethics; Privacy; Public engagement,Humans; COVID-19/epidemiology; Pandemics; Privacy; Delivery of Health Care; Public Health,10.1016/j.epidem.2022.100652,true

National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidelines and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures are used to identify persistent asthma, the former method used by clinicians, and the latter by managed care organizations (MCOs). This study aims to determine the degree of agreement between these criteria in classifying pediatric persistent asthma. Asthmatic patients aged 5-18 years old in a university pediatric practice who were continuously enrolled with one MCO from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013 (Cohort 1: 329 patients) and January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2014 (Cohort 2: 212 patients) were identified. Subjects with at least one asthma visit were included. Independence of NHLBI and HEDIS criteria was determined by the McNemar test.

Shashidhara; Debajyoti Mukhopadhyay,"With the advancement of communication technology, Telecare Medicine Information Systems (TMIS) provides convenient healthcare services for patients, doctors, and health organizations over the insecure Internet. As a result, when accessing sensitive medical data over an insecure connection, user privacy, data security, and user authentication is very crucial. A secure authentication protocol plays a crucial role in securing communications over TMIS, these environments are very vulnerable to numerous attacks due to resource constraints and the nature of the communication medium. Recently, an efficient authentication framework has been introduced for TMIS to address various security issues. However, the existing mutual authentication and key agreement protocols are vulnerable to replay attacks, insider attacks, impersonation attacks, and password guessing attacks. Furthermore, the current authentication systems do not guarantee user privacy and the fair key agreement between the patient and the medical server. We propose a more robust authentication approach for healthcare information systems to address these security issues. To assess the authentication protocol's security strength, we employ formal verification tools like Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA). Finally, a thorough performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed mutual authentication framework not only ensures privacy but also maintains a low computing overhead. As a result, when compared to other related systems, the proposed authentication protocol is both secure and computationally efficient.",Computer science; Mutual authentication; Computer security; Authentication protocol; Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol; Authentication (law); Challenge–response authentication; Password; Internet security; Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol; Key (lock); Security service; Information security,,,10.1002/spy2.228,false

We need to address this issue in a developing country’s perspective,as oral healthcare is not an integral part of antenatal protocols.Objective: To evaluate the oral health status of pregnant women using Oral Hygiene Index-Simplified (OHI-S) Score as well as explore oral hygiene practice by them and conduct a mini-assessment of their knowledge of oral health.Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted using data by using a semi-structured questionnaire among 170 pregnant women attending an antenatal center in Dhaka city, Bangladesh,from March to August of 2018. A pre-tested semi structured questionnaire containing OHI-S indexwas used for data collection. Dental mirror and probe were used for oral hygiene assessment.Results: The mean age of the participants was 24.22±5.07 years. 140(82.4%) were found to use toothbrushes as a tooth-cleaning aid and 146(85.9%) used toothpaste as a tooth cleaning material. Among them, 132(94.3%) were found to brush at least once a day. The predominant health problems identified by clinical examination among those pregnant women were gum bleeding, mild to severe periodontitis, halitosis (bad breath) and loose teeth. The majority didnot know the safe period of dental treatment and the consequences of having poor oral health during pregnancy. The overall oral hygiene status of the maximum pregnant women was ‘Fair’ (50.6%) (OHI-S score 0-1.2), while 39.4% had ‘Poor’ oral hygiene status (OHI-S score 1.3-3.0) and only 10% had ‘Good’ oral hygiene status (OHI-S score 3.1-6.9).Conclusion: Pregnant women in Bangladesh suffer from various oral health issues during pregnancy; however, they exhibit that they do not address this issue due to lack of awareness and other factors. Hence, it is crucial to plan and implement effective oral health programmes for pregnant women all over the country.International Journal of Human and Health Sciences Vol. 06 No. 03 July’22 Page: 298-303</jats:p>",Medicine; Oral hygiene; Oral health; Tooth brushing; Pregnancy; Dentistry; Cross-sectional study; Periodontitis; Family medicine; Obstetrics; Toothbrush; Pathology; Biology; Electrical engineering; Genetics; Engineering; Brush,,,10.31344/ijhhs.v6i3.462,true

This study assesses geographic and socioeconomic disparities in access to reperfusion procedures in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients residing in Piedmont (Italy). Methods : Coronary Care Units (CCUs) were geocoded with a geographic information system (GIS) and the shortest drive time from CCUs to patients’ residence was computed and categorized as 0 to <20, 20 to <40 and ≥40 min. Using data on AMI emergency hospitalizations in 2004–2012, we employed a log-binomial regression model to evaluate the relation between drive time and use of Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) occurring within 2 days after a hospitalization for an episode of AMI, and whether this relation varied depending on the period of hospitalization. Results : A total of 29% of all cases with a diagnosis of AMI ( n = 66 097), were revascularized within 2 days from the index admission. The further AMI patients lived from CCUs, the less likely they were to receive revascularization: compared with distance <20 min, RRs were respectively 0.84 [95% CI 0.80–0.88] and 0.78 [95% CI 0.71–0.86]. Findings also showed that less educated people had a lower relative risk of being revascularized compared to more educated people (RR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.74–0.82). Both inequalities have reduced in recent years. Conclusion : This study provides evidence of reduced geographical and socioeconomic differences in revascularization use over time.

Good public awareness of cancer signs and symptoms has a positive impact on the time patients take before they present to healthcare professionals. Therefore, this study examined public knowledge of cancer signs and symptoms as well as risk factors in Gaza. This was a cross-sectional study. Participants were recruited from adult visitors (≥18 years) to governmental hospitals covering all five governorates of Gaza, and adolescent students (15 to 17 years) from 10 high schools in corresponding locations. An Arabic version of the Cancer Awareness Measure (CAM) was completed in a face-to-face interview. It described demographic data and knowledge of: cancer prevalence, age-related risk, signs and symptoms as well as risk factors both in recall and recognition questions. Of 3033 participants invited, 2886 completed the CAM (response rate = 95.2%). Adult mean age ± standard deviation was 33.7 ± 11.7 years and that of adolescents was 16.3 ± 0.8 years. Half of the participants (n = 1457, 50.5%) were adolescent (781 females; 53.6%) and 1429 (49.5%) were adult (702 females; 49.1%). About two thirds (n = 1885) thought about cancer as unrelated to age. Only 196 participants (6.8%) identified colorectal cancer as the most common cancer among men. Awareness of cancer signs/symptoms was poor to fair, where ‘lump’ was most commonly recognized (n = 2227, 77.2%) and ‘change of bowel habit’ the least (n = 670, 23.2%). Only 217 participants (7.5%) had a good level of recognizing risk factors with ‘smoking’ being the most identified and ‘eating less than five portions of fruits and vegetables a day’ the least. There was a higher likelihood for adults to identify most cancer signs/symptoms and risk factors than adolescents, except for recalling ‘unexplained pain’, ‘persistent cough/hoarseness’, ‘non-healing ulcer’, ‘smoking’, and ‘eating less than five portions of fruits and vegetables a day’. Public awareness of cancer signs/symptoms and risk factors needs to improve to facilitate early presentation and diagnosis in Gaza.

Parents often turn to their peers to share their experiences, gain support and lobby for change; increasingly this is done through social media. The WellChild #notanurse_but is a parent-driven campaign that states its aim is to “shine a light” on the care parents, who are not nurses, have to undertake for their child with complex health care needs and to raise decision-makers’ awareness of the gaps in service provision and support. ; ; This paper reports on a study that analysed the #notanurse_but parent-driven campaign videos. The purpose of the study was to consider the videos in terms of the range, content and context, the perspectivity (motivation), and the affect (sense of being there) in order to inform the future direction of the campaign. Analysis involved repeated viewing of a subset of 30 purposively selected videos and documenting our analysis on a specifically designed data extraction sheet. Each video was analysed by a minimum of two researchers. ; ; All but two of the thirty videos were filmed inside the home. A variety of filming techniques were used. Mothers were the main narrators in all but one set of videos. The sense of perspectivity was clearly linked to the campaign with the narration pressing home the reality, complexity and need for vigilance in caring for a child with complex health care needs. Different clinical tasks and routines undertaken as part of the child’s care were depicted. Videos also reported on a sense of feeling different to “normal families”; the affect varied amongst the researchers, ranging from strong to weaker emotional responses. ; ; The lives of families of children with complex needs are largely hidden from the eyes of healthcare professionals, policy makers and other stakeholders.

The purpose of this paper is illustrating the consequences of Iranian household to health system financial contribution in terms of burden and incomes approaches.METHOD: The Data derived from an annual survey by Statistics Center of Iran (SCI) on expenditure-income of 36,551 households in 2012 was used to analyze countrywide distribution indicators of households' medical expenses by measuring indices of Income and burden approaches based on World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank recommended methodologies.RESULTS: The fairness in financial contribution index was 0.85 and 0.82, and the income redistributive effect index was 0.54 and 0.3 in urban and rural areas, respectively. The fairness in financial contribution index was found 0.84 and 0.83 and the income redistributive effect index was 0.48 and 0.25 for households with and without medical insurance, respectively.The percentages of household with catastrophic health payments were 2.4% and 4% and the change in the number of household falling below the poverty line due to health system payments was 0.4% and 2% in urban and rural areas, respectively. The percentages of household with catastrophic health payments were 2.8% and 3% and the change in the number of household falling below the poverty line due to health system payments was 0.008 and 0.011 for households with and without medical insurance, respectively.CONCLUSION: Distribution indicators of medical expenses were more favorable in urban areas compared to rural areas and Medical insurance has declined impoverishment risks and number of people suffered due to catastrophic health expenditure. In addition, the result showed that there are different approaches for analyzing the distribution of out of pocket payments which used to complement each other in respect of formulation and development policy making in health system.",Finance; Rural area; Payment; Poverty; Index (economics); Medical insurance; System a; World health; Distribution (economics); Medicine,,,10.5539/gjhs.v8n10p233,true

We synthesise the current evidence regarding the family and healthcare provider experience of critical congenital heart disease diagnosis and management. A systematic integrative literature review was conducted by keyword search of online databases, MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO, Cochrane, cumulative index to nursing and allied health literature (CINAHL Plus) and two journals, the Journal of Indigenous Research and Midwifery Journal from 1990. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to search results with citation mining of final included papers to ensure completeness. Two researchers assessed study quality combining three tools. A third researcher reviewed papers where no consensus was reached. Data was coded and analysed in four phases resulting in final refined themes to summarise the findings. Of 1817 unique papers, 22 met the inclusion criteria. The overall quality of the included studies was generally good, apart from three of fair quality. There is little information on the experience of the healthcare provider. Thematic analysis identified three themes relating to the family experience: (1) The diagnosis and treatment of a critical congenital heart disease child significantly impacts parental health and wellbeing. (2) The way that healthcare and information is provided influences parental response and adaptation, and (3) parental responses and adaptation can be influenced by how and when support occurs. The experience of diagnosis and management of a critical congenital heart disease child is stressful and life-changing for families.

Slørdahl; Kaare H. Bønaa,"Background Disease-specific registers may be used for measuring and improving healthcare and patient outcomes, and for disease surveillance and research, provided they contain valid and reliable data. The aim of this study was to assess the interrater reliability of all variables in a national myocardial infarction register. Methods We randomly selected 280 patients who had been enrolled from 14 hospitals to the Norwegian Myocardial Infarction Register during the year 2013. Experienced audit nurses, who were blinded to the data about the 280 patients already in the register, completed the Norwegian Myocardial Infarction paper forms for 240 patients by review of medical records. We then extracted all registered data on the same patients from the Norwegian Myocardial Infarction Register. To compare the interrater reliability between the register and the audit nurses, we calculated intraclass correlations coefficient for continuous variables, Cohen's kappa and Gwet's first agreement coefficient (AC1) for nominal variables, and quadratic weighted Cohen's kappa and Gwet's second AC for ordinal variables. Results We found excellent (AC1 >0.80) or good (AC1 0.61-0.80) agreement for most variables, including date and time variables, medical history, investigations and treatments during hospitalization, medication at discharge, and ST-segment elevation or non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction. However, only moderate agreement (AC1 0.41-0.60) was found for family history of coronary heart disease, diagnostic electrocardiography, and complications during hospitalization, whereas fair agreement (AC1 0.21-0.40) was found for acute myocardial infarction location. A high percentage of missing data was found for symptom onset, family history, body mass index, infarction location, and new Q-wave. Conclusion Most variables in Norwegian Myocardial Infarction Register had excellent or good reliability. However, some important variables had lower reliability than expected or had missing data.

Bajaj; Aoife M. Egan; Céline Huot; Ryan Batten; Lisa Bishop; Devonne Ryan; Erin Davis; Nazia Darvesh; Arifur Rahman; Shabnam Asghari; Lily Acheampong; Andrea C. Tricco,"Recent surveys of Canadian cannabis users reflect increasing consumption rates, some of whom may have diabetes. However, healthcare providers have limited information resources on the effects of recreational cannabis in people with diabetes. This rapid review was commissioned by Diabetes Canada to synthesize available evidence to guide recommendations for care of people 13 years of age and older who live with diabetes. PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO databases were searched from January 2008 to January 2019. Study selection, data abstraction and quality appraisal were completed by pairs of reviewers working independently and discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer with pilot tests completed before each stage to ensure consistency. Data collected from included studies were tabulated and summarized descriptively. The search resulted in 1848 citations of which 59 publications were selected for screening, resulting in six observational studies (2 full-text articles and 4 conference abstracts) that met the pre-defined criteria for inclusion. Five studies reported higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who consumed recreational cannabis. In one study, students aged 17 to 25 years living with T1D self-reported poorer glycemic control and higher HbA1c when smoking cannabis. In one study of adults with T1D, cannabis use within the previous 12 months was associated with almost double the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis compared with no cannabis use (odds ratio [OR] 1.98; confidence interval [CI] [95% CI] 1.01–3.91). Risks for peripheral arterial occlusion and myocardial infarction were found to be higher in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who consumed recreational cannabis, and worse renal parameters were also reported in two separate studies of T1D and T2D. Recreational cannabis use may negatively impact diabetes metabolic factors and self-management behaviours in people with T1D. In people with T2D, recreational cannabis may increase risks for peripheral arterial occlusion, myocardial infarction and renal disease. However, the evidence base of this rapid review was limited to six observational studies of poor to fair methodological quality, and thus, further robust, higher quality research is required to confirm the potential impact of cannabis on diabetes.

The overproducation and underconsumption are usually due to the lack of accountability, transparency, traceability, audit, assessment, security, and trust features in the current healthcare supply chain systems. It is required to ensure that everyone is getting a fair share of medical supplies without unnecessary waste. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution that ensures the commitment and accountability of all participants to prevent them from producing any unnecessary waste. We introduce five phases, such as registration, commitment, production, delivery, and consumption, to perform the waste assessment accurately and fairly. We develop four smart contracts that ensure data provenance, transparency, security, and accountability while recording all actions on an immutable ledger automatically. We utilize offchain decentralized storage to deal with the large data problem. We present five algorithms and discuss each phase of the proposed solution, along with their full implementation, testing, and validation details. We conduct the security analysis to ensure that our smart contracts are secure enough and they do not have vulnerabilities and flaws. The smart contracts code is made publicly available on GitHub.",Traceability; Accountability; Transparency (behavior); Computer science; Supply chain; Smart contract; Blockchain; Computer security; Audit; Production (economics); Risk analysis (engineering); Business; Accounting; Software engineering; Marketing; Political science; Economics; Law; Macroeconomics,,,10.1109/access.2022.3188778,true

Chen; Indra Neil Sarkar,"Background There is a recognized need to improve how scholarly data are managed and accessed. The scientific community has proposed the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principles to address this issue. Objective The objective of this case study was to develop a system for improving the FAIRness of Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's State Emergency Department Databases (HCUP's SEDD) within the context of data catalog availability. Methods A search tool, EDCat (Emergency Department Catalog), was designed to improve the “FAIRness” of electronic health databases and tested on datasets from HCUP-SEDD. ElasticSearch was used as a database for EDCat's search engine. Datasets were curated and defined. Searchable data dictionary-related elements and unified medical language system (UMLS) concepts were included in the curated metadata. Functionality to standardize search terms using UMLS concepts was added to the user interface. Results The EDCat system improved the overall FAIRness of HCUP-SEDD by improving the findability of individual datasets and increasing the efficacy of searches for specific data elements and data types. Discussion The databases considered for this case study were limited in number as few data distributors make the data dictionaries of datasets available. The publication of data dictionaries should be encouraged through the FAIR principles, and further efforts should be made to improve the specificity and measurability of the FAIR principles. Conclusion In this case study, the distribution of datasets from HCUP-SEDD was made more FAIR through the development of a search tool, EDCat.

108-646-603-866-479,A Scheduling Mechanism Based on Optimization Using IoT-Tasks Orchestration for Efficient Patient Health Monitoring.,2021,journal article,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Switzerland,Naeem Iqbal; null Imran; Shabir Ahmad; Rashid Ahmad; Do-Hyeun Kim,"Over the past years, numerous Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare systems have been developed to monitor patient health conditions, but these traditional systems do not adapt to constraints imposed by revolutionized IoT technology. IoT-based healthcare systems are considered mission-critical applications whose missing deadlines cause critical situations. For example, in patients with chronic diseases or other fatal diseases, a missed task could lead to fatalities. This study presents a smart patient health monitoring system (PHMS) based on an optimized scheduling mechanism using IoT-tasks orchestration architecture to monitor vital signs data of remote patients. The proposed smart PHMS consists of two core modules: a healthcare task scheduling based on optimization and optimization of healthcare services using a real-time IoT-based task orchestration architecture. First, an optimized time-constraint-aware scheduling mechanism using a real-time IoT-based task orchestration architecture is developed to generate autonomous healthcare tasks and effectively handle the deployment of emergent healthcare tasks. Second, an optimization module is developed to optimize the services of the e-Health industry based on objective functions. Furthermore, our study uses Libelium e-Health toolkit to monitors the physiological data of remote patients continuously. The experimental results reveal that an optimized scheduling mechanism reduces the tasks starvation by 14% and tasks failure by 17% compared to a conventional fair emergency first (FEF) scheduling mechanism. The performance analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, and it suggests that the proposed solution can be an effective and sustainable solution towards monitoring patient's vital signs data in the IoT-based e-Health domain.",Software deployment; Scheduling (computing); Distributed computing; Architecture; Health care; Domain (software engineering); Orchestration (computing); Task (project management); Computer science; Mechanism (biology),Internet of Things; optimization; remote health monitoring; smart healthcare; vital signs monitoring,"Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Internet of Things; Monitoring, Physiologic; Vital Signs",10.3390/s21165430,true

Habermann,"Background The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) is a publicly reported survey of patient experience with in-hospital care. We reviewed institutional HCAHPS survey data to assess our patients’ experiences after cardiac surgery and to identify targets for practice improvement. Methods We reviewed data from patients undergoing the most common cardiac operations, with dismissal from October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2015. We used top-box methodology to combine survey results into nine domains, including the global (composite) hospital rating, dichotomized as high versus low. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the independent associations of variables with low global ratings. Key driver analysis using domain means and Spearman correlation between the global rating and the eight other domains identified targets for quality improvement. Results Among 1,315 surveyed patients a low global hospital rating was independently associated with low perceived overall health (fair or poor vs excellent; odds ratio [OR], 5.4; p = 0.001), younger age (18 to 59 vs ≥70 years; OR, 1.6; p = 0.048), prolonged length of stay (OR, 1.6; p = 0.02), and robotic mitral valve (MV) repair (robotic vs open repair; OR, 2.4; p = 0.045). Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) reported global ratings similar to that of patients with open aortic valve operations (OR, 0.9; p = 0.64). Key drivers of patient experience were care transitions and communication regarding medications. Conclusions The primary targets of improvement for our institution are care transitions and communications regarding medications. The less-invasive procedures (robotic MV repair, TAVR) were not independently associated with higher patient-experience scores.",Logistic regression; Odds ratio; Emergency medicine; Mitral valve; Patient experience; Cardiac surgery; Valve replacement; Aortic valve; Global Rating; Medicine,,Adolescent; Aged; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Female; Health Care Surveys/methods; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Quality Improvement; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2018.09.049,true

It becomes critical to ensure that these models make accurate predictions, are robust to shifts in the data, do not rely on spurious features, and do not unduly discriminate against minority groups. To this end, several approaches spanning various areas such as explainability, fairness, and robustness have been proposed in recent literature. Such approaches need to be human-centered as they cater to the understanding of the models to their users. However, there is little to no research on understanding the needs and challenges in monitoring deployed machine learning (ML) models from a human-centric perspective. To address this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 practitioners who are experienced with deploying ML models and engaging with customers spanning domains such as financial services, healthcare, hiring, online retail, computational advertising, and conversational assistants. We identified various human-centric challenges and requirements for model monitoring in real-world applications. Specifically, we found that relevant stakeholders would want model monitoring systems to provide clear, unambiguous, and easy-to-understand insights that are readily actionable. Furthermore, our study also revealed that stakeholders desire customization of model monitoring systems to cater to domain-specific use cases.</jats:p>",Perspective (graphical); Personalization; Computer science; Robustness (evolution); Data science; Spurious relationship; Domain (mathematical analysis); Knowledge management; Risk analysis (engineering); Business; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; World Wide Web; Mathematical analysis; Biochemistry; Chemistry; Mathematics; Gene,,,10.1609/hcomp.v10i1.21997,false

Friedman,"Introduction The growth of data science has led to an explosion in new knowledge alongside various approaches to representing and sharing biomedical knowledge in computable form. These changes have not been matched by an understanding of what healthcare delivery organizations need to do to adapt and continuously deploy computable knowledge. It is therefore important to begin to conceptualize such changes in order to facilitate routine and systematic application of knowledge that improves the health of individuals and populations. Methods An AHRQ-funded conference convened a group of experts from a range of fields to analyze the current state of knowledge management in healthcare delivery organizations and describe how it needs to evolve to enable computable knowledge management. Presentations and discussions were recorded and analyzed by the author team to identify foundational concepts and new domains of healthcare delivery organization knowledge management capabilities. Results Three foundational concepts include 1) the current state of knowledge management in healthcare delivery organizations relies on an outdated biomedical library model, and only a small number of organizations have developed enterprise-scale knowledge management approaches that ""push"" knowledge in computable form to frontline decisions, 2) the concept of Learning Health Systems creates an imperative for scalable computable knowledge management approaches, and 3) the ability to represent data science discoveries in computable form that is FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) is fundamental to spread knowledge at scale. For healthcare delivery organizations to engage with computable knowledge management at scale, they will need new organizational capabilities across three domains: policies and processes, technology, and people. Examples of specific capabilities were developed. Conclusions Healthcare delivery organizations need to substantially scale up and retool their knowledge management approaches in order to benefit from computable biomedical knowledge.",Order (exchange); Interoperability; Scale (chemistry); Library model; Biomedical knowledge; Healthcare delivery; Computer science; Scalability; Concept learning; Knowledge management,healthcare delivery; knowledge management; organizational competencies,,10.1002/lrh2.10070,true

Precision medicine helps reduce trial-and-error prescribing and minimize adverse drug reactions while improving the drug's effectiveness. Precision medicine is a medical method that seeks to maximize healthcare quality by tailoring the healthcare process to each patient's unique characteristics. In the era of rapid technological growth and data explosion, precision medicine's development has become very promising. Development of techniques for obtaining medical data; significant reductions in the cost of bio sequencing; massive development of computing tools, storage systems, and wireless communication systems; as well as the development of data analysis techniques based on artificial intelligence have all become significant driving forces in the advancement of precision medicine. In this manuscript, we summarized previous studies on precision medicine development. In addition, we discussed the opportunities and potential challenges of precision medicine development, particularly in Indonesia. Despite its promising potential, many challenges remain to be overcome to develop precision medicine. Good regulations for patient data ownership and clinical data-sharing, followed by sufficient data infrastructure and human resource capabilities, are the most critical factors in ensuring success in precision medicine. Moreover, guaranteeing data safety, patient privacy, and genome fairness are other issues that must be addressed.</jats:p>",Precision medicine; Computer science; Health care; Risk analysis (engineering); Data sharing; Drug development; Data science; Process (computing); Resource (disambiguation); Perspective (graphical); Quality (philosophy); Medicine; Artificial intelligence; Alternative medicine; Computer network; Philosophy; Drug; Epistemology; Pathology; Psychiatry; Economics; Economic growth; Operating system,,,10.11591/ijphs.v12i1.22010,false

We applied and compared several machine-learning algorithms to predict frequent ED use, then selected a model based on accuracy, parsimony, and interpretability.; ; Results; We identified 2691 children. In bivariate analyses, future frequent ED use was associated with demographics, co-morbidities, insurance status, medication history, and use of healthcare resources. Machine learning algorithms had very good AUC (area under the curve) values [0.66-0.87], though fair PPV (positive predictive value) [48-70%] and poor sensitivity [16-27%]. Our final multivariable logistic regression model contained two variables: insurance status and prior ED use. For publicly insured patients, the odds of frequent ED use were 3.1 [2.2-4.5] times that of privately insured patients.

Objective To examine sociodemographic, general health, and COPD specific factors, including severity of lung obstruction, that are associated with healthcare provider-diagnosed COPD among U.S. adults. Methods NHANES cross-sectional data collected from 2007-2012 on adults aged 40-79 years (n=10,219) were analyzed. The primary outcome was self-reported COPD diagnosis with predictive factors analyzed via chi-square and logistic regression analyses. Results During 2007-2012, 5.2% of US adults aged 40-79 reported being diagnosed with COPD. Among those diagnosed, 50.8% reported fair or poor health, 47.1% were currently smoking cigarettes, 49.1% were taking prescription respiratory medication, 36.4% had moderate or worse lung obstruction, and nearly 90% had one or more respiratory symptoms. Logistic regression revealed positive associations between receiving a COPD diagnosis and the following: being white (AOR: 3.08, 95% CI: 1.82-5.20); being aged 60-79 years (AOR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.07-2.53); reporting fair/poor health (AOR: 2.91, CI: 1.55-5.46); having 4-9 (AOR: 3.5, CI: 1.3-9.4) or 10 or more healthcare visits in prior year (AOR: 5.06, CI: 1.62-15.77); being a former (AOR: 1.75, CI: 1.2-2.5) or current smoker (AOR: 1.70, CI: 1.17-2.48); having more severe lung obstruction (AOR: 4.90, CI: 3.28-7.32); having 3 or more respiratory symptoms (AOR: 22.07, CI: 12.03-40.49).

Articles comparing menthol versus non-menthol cigarette smokers in terms of at least one predefined smoking cessation outcome were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence-Based Practice Center approach. A random-effects model utilizing the DerSimonian and Laird method to pool adjusted odds ratio was applied. Variations among pooled studies were assessed using Cochran’s Q statistic, and heterogeneity was quantified using the inconsistency index (I2). Forty-three demographically adjusted studies (22 rated “good”, 20 rated “fair”, and one study rated “poor” individual study quality) comparing menthol and non-menthol smokers were qualitatively synthesized across the following measures (study count; strength of evidence): duration of abstinence (2; low); quit attempts (15; insufficient); rate of abstinence/quitting (29; moderate); change in smoking quantity/frequency (5; insufficient); and, return to smoking/relapse (2; insufficient). Overall, the qualitative synthesis failed to show a consistent trend for an association between menthol cigarette use and smoking cessation across outcomes. Meta-analyses found no difference between menthol and non-menthol cigarette use and either quit attempts or abstinence. Given the lack of consistency or statistical significance in the findings—combined with a “low” overall strength of evidence grade, based on deficiencies of indirectness and inconsistency—no consistent or significant associations between menthol cigarette use and smoking cessation were identified. Recommendations for future studies include increased focus on providing longitudinal, adjusted data collected from standardized outcome measures of cessation to better inform long-term smoking cessation and menthol cigarette use. Such improvements should also be further considered in more methodologically rigorous systematic reviews characterized by objectivity, comprehensiveness, and transparency with the ultimate objective of better informing public health and policy decision making.",Demography; Health psychology; Odds ratio; Systematic review; Smoking cessation; MEDLINE; Menthol; Abstinence; Medicine; Meta-analysis,Menthol cigarettes; Meta-analysis; Smoking; Smoking cessation; Systematic reviews,Humans; Menthol; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Tobacco Products; Tobacco Use Cessation Devices; United States,10.1186/s13011-021-00397-4,true

In this paper, we investigate how to allocate limited resources to {locally interacting} communities in a way to maximize a pertinent notion of equitability. In particular, we look at the dynamic setting where the allocation is repeated across multiple periods (e.g., yearly), the local communities evolve in the meantime (driven by the provided allocation), and the allocations are modulated by feedback coming from the communities themselves. We employ recent mathematical tools stemming from data-driven feedback online optimization, by which communities can learn their (possibly unknown) evolution, satisfaction, as well as they can share information with the deciding bodies. We design dynamic policies that converge to an allocation that maximize equitability in the long term. We further demonstrate our model and methodology with realistic examples of healthcare and education subsidies design in Sub-Saharian countries. One of the key empirical takeaways from our setting is that long-term equitability is fragile, in the sense that it can be easily lost when deciding bodies weigh in other factors (e.g., equality in allocation) in the allocation strategy. Moreover, a naive compromise, while not providing significant advantage to the communities, can promote inequality in social outcomes.",Computer science; Subsidy; Term (time); Resource allocation; Compromise; Fragility; Key (lock); Management science; Economics; Political science; Computer security; Computer network; Chemistry; Physics; Physical chemistry; Quantum mechanics; Law; Market economy,,,10.1145/3514094.3534132,true

Dagher,"Blockchain is an emerging distributed and decentralized technology that promises to revolutionize the healthcare sector by securely storing and maintaining incorruptible electronic health record data. Consensus protocols are at the core of blockchain technology. They establish security and integrity in the system by ensuring that the majority of miners are in agreement on all transactions and blocks added to the distributed ledger. While many consensus protocols have been proposed, most of them require heavy computation and are not scalable. In this work, we propose a novel permissioned consensus protocol, named ACCORD, a multi-leader (quorum-based) protocol that achieves fork-resistance, robustness, and scalability. To achieve this, ACCORD consists of three distinct components: (1) an asynchronous quorum selection procedure to designate the creators of future blocks, (2) a block creation protocol run by the quorum to prevent omissions in the presence of honest quorum members, and (3) a decentralized arbitration protocol to ensure consensus by voting. Additionally, we implemented the protocol and conducted experiments to demonstrate scalability, robustness, and fairness.",Computer science; Scalability; Blockchain; Robustness (evolution); Asynchronous communication; Protocol (science); Distributed computing; Computer security; Computer network; Database; Medicine; Biochemistry; Chemistry; Alternative medicine; Pathology; Gene,,,10.1109/tifs.2022.3198860,false

M. Leufkens; Carla E. M. Hollak,"Background: The European Commission highlights in its Pharmaceutical Strategy the role of academic researchers in drug repurposing, especially in the development of orphan medicinal products (OMPs). This study summarizes the contribution of academia over the last 5 years to registered repurposed OMPs and describes barriers to success, based upon three real world cases. Methods: OMPs granted marketing authorization between January 2016 and December 2020 were reviewed for repurposing and whether the idea originated from academia or industry. Three cases of drug repurposing were selected from different therapeutic areas and stages of development to identify obstacles to success. Results: Thirteen of the 68 OMPs were the result of drug repurposing. In three OMPs, there were two developments such as both a new indication and a modified application. In total, twelve developments originated from academia and four from industry. The three cases showed as barriers to success: lack of outlook for sufficient return of investments (abatacept), lack of regulatory alignment and timing of interaction between healthcare professionals and regulators (etidronate), failure to register an old drug for a fair price, resulting in commercialization as a high priced orphan drug (mexiletine). Conclusion: While the majority of repurposed OMPs originates in academia, a gap exists between healthcare professionals, regulators and industry. Future strategies should aim to overcome these hurdles leading to more patient benefit through sustainable access of repurposed drugs. Potential solutions include improved regulatory and reimbursement knowledge by academia and the right for regulators to integrate new effectiveness data into product labels.",Drug repositioning; Business; Off-label use; Marketing authorization; Reimbursement; Commercialization; Public relations; Product (business); Repurposing; Orphan drug,abatacept; drug repurposing; etidronate; mexiletine; off-label; orphan drugs; rare diseases; reimbursement,,10.3389/fphar.2021.746987,true

Therefore, it is important to predict the need for diabetic patients to be hospitalized. However, using standard machine learning approaches to make these predictions may result in health disparities caused by biases in the data related to social determinants (such as race, age, and gender). These biases must be removed early in the data collection process, before they enter the system and are reinforced by model predictions, resulting in biases in the model’s decisions. In this paper, we propose a machine learning pipeline capable of making predictions as well as detecting and mitigating biases in the data and model predictions. This pipeline analyses the clinical data and determines whether biases exist in the data, if so, it removes those biases before making predictions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on a clinical dataset using accuracy and fairness measures. The findings of the results show that when we mitigate biases early during the data ingestion, we get fairer predictions. • We propose a machine learning pipeline capable of making predictions in healthcare settings. • We mitigate health disparities through AI based techniques. • We propose a generalizable machine learning pipeline for mitigating health disparities. • We show outcomes from healthcare data that are fairer. • We propose to mitigate biases early in the data collection process.",Medicine; Computer science,,,10.1016/j.health.2022.100100,true

Online health information is popular and accessible, but quality is questionable and its benefits dependent on an individual's eHealth literacy. This study examined online health information-seeking behaviours, eHealth literacy and its predictors among first-generation Chinese immigrants. A sample of 356 Chinese immigrants living in Australia completed an anonymous paper-based survey, including sociodemographic, clinical data, English proficiency, health literacy, online health information-seeking behaviours, and eHealth literacy. Linear regression models analyzed predictive factors of eHealth literacy. Participants were aged mean 59.3 years, female (68.3%), 53.1% completed university, and their English proficiency was rated fair/poor by 75.1%. Participants perceived online health information as useful (61.6%) and important (56.2%) to their health. Health information accessed was often related to lifestyle (61.2%), health resources (44.9%), diseases (36.0%), and medications (30.9%). Inadequate health literacy and eHealth literacy occurred in 48.3% and 44.9%, respectively. Age, number of technological devices used, education, and health status were independently associated with eHealth literacy. While most Chinese immigrants used online health information, many had inadequate eHealth literacy.

O'Donnell; Mary Eapen; Lindsey R. Sangaralingham; Viengneesee Thao; Joshua A. Roth; Winona E Wright; Scott David Ramsey,"<jats:p> 6591 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: BMT CTN 1101 was a Phase III randomized controlled trial evaluating the comparative effectiveness of unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) versus HLA-haploidentical related donor bone marrow (haplo-BM) cell sources for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies (leukemias, lymphomas). We report results of an economic evaluation conducted as part of the clinical trial. Methods: 368 patients (90% of planned accrual) enrolled from 33 centers in the U.S. were randomly assigned to unrelated UCB (n=186) or haplo-BM (n=182) transplant. Healthcare utilization and costs were estimated using propensity-score matched cohorts of BMT patients in the OptumLabs Data Warehouse for trial participants &lt;65 years, and Medicare claims for trial participants ≥65 years. Cost-effectiveness was calculated from payer perspectives (commercial, Medicare) over a 20-year time horizon from time of transplant. Weibull models (best fit based on AIC/BIC) were used to extrapolate survival from 5-year trial follow-up data. Trial participant surveys (EQ-5D) were used to derive health state utilities for estimating Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty in results. Outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. Results: At 5-year follow-up, overall survival was 42% for haplo-BM versus 36% for UCB (P=.06). Over a 20-year time horizon, haplo-BM is expected to be more effective and more costly for &lt;65 year-olds and in ≥65 year-olds it is expected to be more effective and less costly. In one-way uncertainty analyses, for persons &lt;65, the cost/QALY result was most sensitive to life years and health state utilities. For persons ≥65, life years were more influential than costs and health state utilities. Using probabilistic sensitivity analysis, for persons &lt;65 there was a 43% chance that haplo-BM was cost-effective using a willingness to pay threshold of $150k/QALY and 52% at a $200K/QALY threshold. Conclusions: Results from a large national clinical trial indicate that compared to UCB, haplo-BM was moderately cost-effective for patients aged &lt;65 years, and less costly and more effective for persons ≥65 years. Haplo-BM is a fair value choice for commercially insured patients with high-risk leukemia and lymphoma who require HCT. For Medicare enrollees, haplo-BM is a preferred choice when considering costs and outcomes.

Patient prioritization tools (PPT) contribute to supporting the prioritization decision process, and to its transparency and fairness. Patient prioritization tools can take various forms and are highly dependent on the particular context of application. Consequently, the sets of criteria change from one context to another, especially when used in non-emergency settings. This paper systematically synthesizes and analyzes the published evidence concerning the development and challenges related to the validation and implementation of PPTs in non-emergency settings. We conducted a systematic mixed studies review. We searched evidence in five databases to select articles based on eligibility criteria, and information of included articles was extracted using an extraction grid. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed by using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The article selection process, data extraction, and quality appraisal were performed by at least two reviewers independently. We included 48 studies listing 34 different patient prioritization tools. Most of them are designed for managing access to elective surgeries in hospital settings. Two-thirds of the tools were investigated based on reliability or validity. Inconclusive results were found regarding the impact of PPTs on patient waiting times. Advantages associated with PPT use were found mostly in relationship to acceptability of the tools by clinicians and increased transparency and equity for patients. This review describes the development and validation processes of PPTs used in non-urgent healthcare settings. Despite the large number of PPTs studied, implementation into clinical practice seems to be an open challenge. Based on the findings of this review, recommendations are proposed to develop, validate, and implement such tools in clinical settings.

117-235-752-727-253,Factors that Play a Role in Improving the Efficiency of Continuous Audits using Computer Assisted Audit Techniques in enterprises including healthcare units,2022,journal article,CARDIOMETRY,RosNOU,,"Sagar, A.; Ramanathan, K.","<jats:p>Internal auditing is a key function of any business enterprise, including healthcare units, being responsible for highlighting and bringing to notice of the upper management a fair evaluation of the organization’s internal control environment. With stakeholder satisfaction, compliance requirements, and value delivery increasingly taking centre stage, it functionally requires many organizations to adopt and implement a continuous auditing solution. Continuous auditing solutions often call for the adoption of various computer-assisted tools and techniques to help get the job done. The usage of these tools and techniques is subject to many different factors. This paper explores some of the factors that play a role in improving the efficiency of continuous audits using such tools and techniques. Auditors widely recognize Computer-assisted auditing techniques (CAATs). However, CAATs are not being used as widely as expected. The technology–organization–environment framework is used to identify and assess the organisational elements that influence CAAT utilisation after adoption. The purpose of this study is to see if using CAATs helps the auditing process. The usage of CAATs by audit firms and audit performance are both moderated by top management commitment. The data for this study was collected from Jordanian audit companies’ auditors. According to the conclusions of the investigation, CAAT adoption is determined by the cost–benefit of technology, company size, preparedness, and competitive pressure. The technical compatibility and complexity of client accounting information systems, on the other hand, appear to have little impact on CAAT utilisation. Top management has a direct impact on audit performance and is a key influencer in how CAATs are used by auditors. However, there is no correlation between audit firm usage of CAATs and audit performance (top management audit firm’s use of CAATs). Furthermore, the adoption of CAATs helps the whole audit process of audit companies.</jats:p>",Audit; Internal audit; Process management; Performance audit; Business; Information technology audit; Operational auditing; Internal control; Stakeholder; Audit plan; Quality audit; Knowledge management; Accounting; Joint audit; Computer science; Management; Economics,,,10.18137/cardiometry.2022.24.385392,true

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mapping feasibility against HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources® (FHIR)® of a generic metadata schema (MDS) created for a central search hub gathering COVID-19 health research (studies, questionnaires, documents = MDS resource types). Mapping results were rated by calculating the percentage of FHIR coverage. Among 86 items to map, total mapping coverage was 94%: 50 (58%) of the items were available as standard resources in FHIR and 31 (36%) could be mapped using extensions. Five items (6%) could not be mapped to FHIR. Analyzing each MDS resource type, there was a total mapping coverage of 93% for studies and 95% for questionnaires and documents, with 61% of the MDS items available as standard resources in FHIR for studies, 57% for questionnaires and 52% for documents. Extensions in studies, questionnaires and documents were used in 32%, 38% and 43% of items, respectively. This work shows that FHIR can be used as a standardized format in registries for clinical, epidemiological and public health research.

The greatest increase in people being fully vaccinated was observed in Uganda (20.4% increase), Botswana (18.5% increase), and Zambia (17.9% increase). Most vaccines were obtained through WHO-COVAX agreements. Initially, vaccination was prioritised for healthcare workers (HCWs), the elderly, adults with co-morbidities, and other at-risk groups, with countries now commencing vaccination among children and administering booster doses. Challenges included irregular supply and considerable hesitancy arising from misinformation fuelled by social media activities.

Since 2020, we have been in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The availability of healthcare facilities became limited due to repeated locked down during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, telemedicine service has gained tremendous popularity among healthcare services. Telemedicine service was started at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Deoghar, as a COVID Helpline facility to provide guidance and care to the home isolated COVID-19 patients during the second wave of COVID-19. But we observed that more than 40% of calls were due to non-COVID-19-related problems, but we managed the non-COVID-19-related calls by discussing with a specialist in conference calls or WhatsApp consultation.

This interdisciplinary project, spanning 22 organisations, is connecting data from &gt;50 large research cohorts and data collected through routine healthcare provision across the UK.; ApproachAcross the UK, data has been collected that can help us answer key questions about COVID-19. As the data are in many places with many different processes it is difficult and complex for public health groups, researchers, policymakers, and government to find and access lots of high-quality data quickly and efficiently to make decisions. In collaboration with Health Data Research UK, CO-CONNECT is streamlining processes of accessing data for research.; Results1) Discovering data and meta-analysis: CO-CONNECT enables researchers to determine how many people meet their research criteria within the various datasets across the UK through the Health Data Research Innovation Gateway Cohort Discovery tool e.g. “How many people in each dataset have had a PCR test which was positive and were under the age of 40?” Only summary level, anonymous data are provided so researchers can answer such questions rapidly without requiring multiple data governance permissions and directly contacting each data source. The tool also supports aggregate level meta-analysis of the data.; 2) Detailed analysis: With data governance approvals, researchers can analyse detailed level, standardised, linked, pseudonymised data in a Trusted Research Environment. The common format reduces the effort on each research project, supporting rapid research.; ConclusionProviding data in this de-identifiable, safe way enables rapid, robust research e.g., COVID-19 results from a test centre can be linked to hospital records along with prescriptions from pharmacies enabling researchers to understand whether people with different existing health conditions are more or less susceptible to COVID-19.

The questionnaire included demographic questions as well as knowledge about complicated grief and its symptoms, risk factors and management. The link to the questionnaire website was sent to HCP governmental and private sectors. Data was analyzed using the ordinal regression model by the SPSS 16 software. <b>Results:</b> A total of 887 HCPs (69% female and 31% male) participated in this study. Majority of the participants (594, 70%) had fair overall knowledge about complicated grief while 206 (23.2%) participants had poor knowledge. Poor knowledge level about risk factors for complicated grief was observed in 44.3% of the participants. Fair or poor knowledge about prevention and management of complicate grief was observed in 39.2% of participants. Knowledge about complicated grief had a significant positive relationship with female gender (OR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.15-2.08) and higher education level (OR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.37-2.54). <b>Conclusion:</b> Knowledge of HCPs about complicated grief was low. There is need for HCP knowledge improvement regarding complicated grief by appropriate education.",Grief; Pandemic; Complicated grief; Computer-assisted web interviewing; Traumatic grief; Psychology; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Medicine; Cross-sectional study; Clinical psychology; Psychiatry; Family medicine; Disease; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Pathology; Marketing; Business,Adjustment Disorder; COVID-19; Grief; Health Personnel; Knowledge,,10.18502/ijps.v17i2.8905,true

Current data-processing mechanisms operate through individual consent, and administrative authorisation in mobile health settings are insufficient and ineffective to meet societal needs while simultaneously protecting individuals’ interests. In light of this shift of regulation from individual control to collective governance, this article argues that the principle of the right to health may complement this collective governance model. The right to health principle emphasises solidarity, justice, confidentiality, and collective responsibility, which may balance power asymmetries in the use of health data among different stakeholders.

Inconsistency in drug interaction resources makes prescribing challenging for healthcare professionals. To assess the scope, completeness, and consistency of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between psychotropic and COVID-19 medications in six specific drug information (DI) databases. Methodology For the comparison, six DI resources were used: Portable Electronic Physician Information Database, Micromedex®, Medscape.com, UpToDate®, Drugs.com drug interaction checker, and WebMD.com drug interaction checker. Using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), the gathered data were examined for scope, completeness, and consistency. Results Scope scores were higher for PEPID© than all the other resources (p < 0.001) for each comparison. PEPID© had better overall completeness scores (median 5, Interquartile range [IQR] 5 to 5; p<0.05 for each comparison), except for Drugs.com (p < 0.05 for each comparison), and were more remarkable for Micromedex® (median 5, IQR 5 to 5). The Fleiss kappa scores among the six different DI sources were poor (k < 0.20, p < 0.05) for the category of information related to clinical effects and level of documentation, moderate agreement (k = 0.4 - 0.6, p < 0.05) for the severity and course of action of DDIs, and fair agreement (k = 0.4 - 0.6, p < 0.05) for mechanism. Conclusion A comprehensive, accurate information among DI resources is essential for healthcare professionals that will significantly impact patient care in the clinical practice. Banking on high-quality resources will help healthcare professionals to make an informed decision while prescribing to avoid inappropriate combinations that can adversely affect patient outcomes.",Medicine; Documentation; Drug; Interquartile range; Health care; Consistency (knowledge bases); Family medicine; Pharmacology; Internal medicine; Geometry; Mathematics; Computer science; Economics; Programming language; Economic growth,covid-19 drug; drug interactions; mental disorders; patient care; psychotropic drugs,,10.7759/cureus.20319,true

A. A. Evers,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly applied in healthcare. The expansion of AI in healthcare necessitates AI-related ethical issues to be studied and addressed. This systematic scoping review was conducted to identify the ethical issues of AI application in healthcare, to highlight gaps, and to propose steps to move towards an evidence-informed approach for addressing them. A systematic search was conducted to retrieve all articles examining the ethical aspects of AI application in healthcare from Medline (PubMed) and Embase (OVID), published between 2010 and July 21, 2020. The search terms were “artificial intelligence” or “machine learning” or “deep learning” in combination with “ethics” or “bioethics”. The studies were selected utilizing a PRISMA flowchart and predefined inclusion criteria. Ethical principles of respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, fairness, explicability, and privacy were charted. The search yielded 2166 articles, of which 18 articles were selected for data charting on the basis of the predefined inclusion criteria. The focus of many articles was a general discussion about ethics and AI. Nevertheless, there was limited examination of ethical principles in terms of consideration for design or deployment of AI in most retrieved studies. In the few instances where ethical principles were considered, fairness, preservation of human autonomy, explicability and privacy were equally discussed. The principle of prevention of harm was the least explored topic. Practical tools for testing and upholding ethical requirements across the lifecycle of AI-based technologies are largely absent from the body of reported evidence. In addition, the perspective of different stakeholders is largely missing.</jats:p>",Autonomy; Health care; Inclusion (mineral); Harm; Bioethics; Engineering ethics; Systematic review; MEDLINE; Psychology; Artificial intelligence; Management science; Computer science; Political science; Social psychology; Engineering; Law,,,10.1007/s43681-021-00131-7,true

Understanding factors influencing health services use at late life will help to plan for increasing needs for health care, reducing inequalities in health services use and releasing severe pressures on a highly variable health care system that has constrained public resources and increasing reliance on health insurance and user payments. Drawing on the nationally representative China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study 2013 data, we apply the Andersen healthcare utilization conceptual model to binary logistic regression multivariate analyses to examine the joint predictors of physical examinations, outpatient and inpatient care among the middle-aged and elderly in China. The multivariate analyses find that both physical examinations and inpatient care rates increase significantly by age when health deteriorates. Females are less likely to use inpatient care. Significant socio-economic variations exist in healthcare utilization. Older people with higher education, communist party membership, urban residence, non-agricultural household registration, better financial situation are more likely to have physical examinations or inpatient care. Factors influencing all three types of health care utilization are household expenditure, losing a partner, having multiple chronic diseases or perceiving poor health. With activities of daily living limitations or pain increases the probability of seeing a doctor while with functional loss increases the rates of having physical examinations, but being the ethnic minorities, no social health insurance, with depression, fair or poor memory could be a barrier to having physical examinations or seeing a doctor, which might delay the early diagnose of severe health problems among these groups. Not drinking, not smoking and regular physical exercises are adaptations after having health problems. As a rapidly ageing society, in order to address the increasing needs and inequalities in health care utilization, China is facing a massive challenge to reform the current health care system, improve equitable access to health insurance and financial affordability for the most disadvantaged, as well as to provide more health education and information to the general public.",Health education; Health administration; Public health; Health care; Health promotion; Health equity; Health policy; Medicine; Social determinants of health; Environmental health,,"Activities of Daily Living; Age Distribution; Aged; China/epidemiology; Chronic Disease; Delivery of Health Care/statistics & numerical data; Female; Health Expenditures; Health Services/statistics & numerical data; Health Status; Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data; House Calls/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Insurance, Health; Life Style; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics & numerical data; Physical Examination/statistics & numerical data; Retirement/statistics & numerical data; Sex Distribution; Socioeconomic Factors",10.1186/s12913-016-1307-8,true

However, it is important that the interests of individual stakeholders involved in this data sharing ecosystem are taken into account to ensure fair data sharing practices. In this regard, this qualitative study investigates such practices from the perspectives of a subset of relevant Swiss expert stakeholders, using a distributive justice lens. Using purposive and snowball sampling methodologies, 48 expert stakeholders from the Swiss healthcare and research domains were recruited for semi-structured interviews. After the experts had consented, the interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim, but omitting identifying information to ensure confidentiality and anonymity. A thematic analysis using a deductive approach was conducted to identify fair data sharing practices for secondary research purposes. Themes and subthemes were then identified and developed during the analysis. Three distributive justice themes were identified in the data sharing negotiation processes, and these are: (i) effort, which was subcategorized into two subthemes (i.e. a claim to data reciprocity and other reciprocal advantages, and a claim to transparency on data re-use), (ii) compensation, which was subcategorized into two subthemes (i.e. a claim to an academic compensation and a claim to a financial compensation), and lastly, (iii) contribution, i.e. the significance of data contributions should be matched with a corresponding reward. This qualitative study provides insights, which could inform policy-making on claims and incentives that encourage Swiss expert stakeholders to share their datasets. Importantly, several claims have been identified and justified under the basis of distributive justice principles, whilst some are more debatable and likely insufficient in justifying data sharing activities. Nonetheless, these claims should be taken seriously and discussed more broadly. Indeed, promoting health research while ensuring that healthcare systems guarantee better services, it is paramount to ensure that solutions developed are sustainable, provide fair criteria for academic careers and promote the sharing of high quality data to advance science.",Snowball sampling; Secondary research; Qualitative research; Data quality; Financial compensation; Data sharing; Distributive justice; Public relations; Medicine; Thematic analysis,Data sharing; Fairness; Health Research,Ecosystem; Humans; Information Dissemination; Motivation; Qualitative Research; Switzerland,10.1186/s12913-021-06906-2,true

Estimates predict large-scale shortfalls of healthcare workers in low- and middle-income settings by 2030 and strategies are needed to optimize the health workforce to achieve universal availability and accessibility of healthcare. In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) published guidelines on best practices for CHW engagement, and identified remaining knowledge gaps. Stop TB Partnership's TB REACH initiative has supported interventions using CHWs to deliver TB care in over 30 countries, and utilized the same primary indicator to measure project impact at the population-level for all TB active case finding projects, which makes the results comparable across multiple settings.

This study examined patterns of drug pricing and drug utilization among employees covered by employer medical insurance. A drug price control mechanism was also devised for the employer to ensure fair benefits to all parties without compromising the quality of patient care. This retrospective study was conducted among International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) community members who sought outpatient treatment at the IIUM panel of health clinics serviced by general practitioners from January 2016 to September 2019. Prescription data (drug type, dose, quantity, duration, price, and manufacturer), patient characteristics (age, sex, and diagnosis) and total charges were extracted from the claims database of PMCare, the insurance company managing IIUM medical claims. Patterns of commonly prescribed drugs, drug pricing, profit margins, and total charges per clinic visit were evaluated. Descriptive statistics were used, and all analyses were performed using Stata v15.1. There were a total of 161,146 prescriptions for 10,150 patients in the IIUM community during the study period (48.85% women, mean ± standard deviation; age: 26.33 ± 17.63 years). The most commonly prescribed drug was paracetamol (25.3%), followed by chlorpheniramine (9.46%), cetirizine (7.3%), diphenhydramine (6.13%), loratadine (4.57%), and diclofenac (4.36%). Generic paracetamol (500 mg), which serves as a prime example for details on drug pricing, is commonly charged between Ringgit Malaysia (RM) 5 and 10 for 10 tablets with a profit between 2,400 and 4,900% according to the average cost price of RM 0.20 per 10 tablets. Most patients were charged within the approved coverage limit of RM 45 per clinic visit, with only 2.41% of patients being charged with costs that exceeded this limit. Uncontrolled drug pricing in the private healthcare system in Malaysia indicates that drug prices differ greatly across private healthcare providers most of the prices were charged with high profit margins. Employers may consider a multilayer capping system to prevent inappropriate drug pricing, which will inevitably benefit patients clinically and economically and provide greater patient access to better drug treatment.",Business; Profit (economics); Profit margin; Medical prescription; Private healthcare; Reimbursement; Average cost; Drug Utilization; Descriptive statistics; Family medicine,drug utilization; employer insurance coverage; price control mechanism; private healthcare system in Malaysia; uncontrolled drug pricing,Adolescent; Adult; Child; Drug Costs; Drug Utilization; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Primary Health Care; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult,10.3389/fpubh.2020.551328,true
125-847-709-144-447,"The US Residency Match at 70: What Was, What Is, and What Could Be.",2022,journal article,Journal of graduate medical education,Journal of Graduate Medical Education,Poland,Edwin Williamson; Caroline Soane; J Bryan Carmody,"In the beginning there was chaos, and then there was order. Eighty years ago, the number of internship positions greatly exceeded the number of graduating medical students in the United States. Hospitals therefore competed intensely to fill their spots. No rules governed when applicants should apply, how and when hospitals should offer positions, or how long an applicant should be allowed to entertain an offer.1 Students felt pressure to accept early offers lest no better ones materialize later.To remedy this, in 1945 the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) proposed a “Cooperative Plan” to standardize intern selection by placing an embargo on the release of academic information until an agreed-upon date in the fourth year.1 This policy eliminated early recruiting but replaced it with frenzied recruitment that began the moment student academic credentials were released. Students had only a short window—sometimes less than 12 to 24 hours—to respond to offers, forcing them to make career-altering decisions with incomplete information.1By 1950, it was clear that the Cooperative Plan was at best a partial solution, leading the dean of the University of Chicago to propose an innovative alternative. Instead of being required to accept or decline individual offers, students would submit their preferences to a central clearinghouse. Hospitals would do the same, and this clearinghouse—which eventually came to be called the National Intern Matching Program—would match applicants and hospitals.2Created with the goal to be “as fair as possible to both students and hospitals,” the inaugural Match would, for the first time, allow applicants to fully consider programs and express their preferences freely.2 In response to student protests that the proposed matching algorithm penalized students for ranking programs honestly, last minute adjustments to the algorithm were made; punched cards were submitted; and in March of 1952, a computer matched 5564 senior medical students to one of approximately 10 500 intern positions.1,3In the 70 years since, the National Intern Matching Program has grown into the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) and now provides matching services for not only internships but also categorical residency positions. Although some programs (such as those in urology, ophthalmology, and military hospitals) use separate matching services, the NRMP Match fills the vast majority of residency positions in the United States.Much has changed since the first Match. The matching algorithm has evolved to discourage strategic ranking decisions by applicants, allow simultaneous matching to both intern and advanced positions, and permit couples matching.4 Notably, the matching algorithm used in 1952 was proposed by medical students and approximated the deferred acceptance algorithm identified nearly a decade later by mathematicians as the ideal solution to a 2-sided matching problem.5 The 2012 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences cited the NRMP's algorithm in honoring the recipients' contributions to the theory and practical applications of matching markers.6Changes in the residency application process have been even more dramatic, with the previous surplus of positions standing in stark contrast to circumstances today. Since 1992, the number of applicants submitting a rank order list has exceeded the number of available positions, with 42 549 active applicants (19 902 US MD seniors, 7303 US DO seniors, 12 912 international medical graduates, and 2414 previous US MD and DO graduates) vying for 36 277 postgraduate year 1 (PGY-1) positions in 2022.7In recent years, the NRMP Match has become responsible for assigning an increasing share of PGY-1 positions. In 2008, 71% of all PGY-1 positions had been filled in the previous year's Match. By 2020, the NRMP Match assigned 85% of active residents, with most of the remaining positions assigned by other matching services. This increase coincides with the implementation of the NRMP's “All In” policy, which requires any program participating in the Match to attempt to fill all of the program's positions through the Match or another national matching plan.8Yet, other aspects of the Match have remained constant. Outcomes for graduating US MDs remain good, with 98% of such applicants successfully matching in 1952, and with match rates of approximately 93% for the past 25 years. The NRMP succeeded in eliminating the problems the organization was founded to solve; its subsequent success speaks to the value of the service the organization provides to new physicians and residency programs.But while early offers are long gone, the residency selection process now faces a new set of challenges related to the increasing number of applications submitted by contemporary applicants. In 2020 the average US medical school graduate submitted 70 residency applications.9 The average for some specialties is even higher. For instance, in 2022, the average osteopathic medical school applicant in obstetrics and gynecology submitted 85 applications, while US MD applicants in orthopedic surgery submitted 96 applications, and international medical graduates submitted 100 applications each to internal medicine programs.10 This overapplication increases costs for applicants and programs, leads to reliance on convenient screening metrics in applicant evaluation, and does not ultimately improve Match rates.9Several efforts have recently been made to improve transparency and ease congestion in residency selection. Some specialties have trialed preference signaling, allowing applicants to designate a number of programs in which they have strong interest.11 Meanwhile, obstetrics and gynecology program directors have recommended a common deadline for interview invitation, at least 2 days to reply to an interview offer, and a deadline to notify applicants of their status.12 While it is notable that these innovations have come from medical specialty and residency program director organizations, the NRMP has continued its longstanding effort to allow applicants and programs to fully consider their options through the guidance of its Code of Conduct: forbidding questions about ranking preferences, diminishing financial burdens by making second visits voluntary, and limiting post-interview communication.13After 7 successful decades of Match Days, the NRMP may need only to maintain its current standard of accurate service to ensure the longevity of the organization for decades more. Yet such a view requires a narrow reading of the organization's mission “to match healthcare professionals to graduate medical education…through a process that is fair, equitable, efficient, transparent, and reliable.”13 While these adjectives may accurately describe the NRMP's algorithm to process rank order lists, the residency selection process at large is increasingly viewed as expensive, inequitable, and having adverse effects on medical education.14 Should the NRMP play a bigger role in addressing these problems?Today's NRMP has attained, by virtue of its market share and the nearly indispensable service it provides, a powerful position from which to influence and improve other aspects of residency selection. Further, the NRMP Match Participation Agreements (MPAs) give it the means to do so. Building on its current Code of Conduct and MPAs, the NRMP could further improve the process. Adding the following specific tools would be a meaningful first step:A consistent and transparent timeline for application review could simplify the application process and reduce stress for applicants. The NRMP could delineate a clear timeframe for programs to extend interview invitations, a deadline when applicants must accept or decline, and a date when a final decision is made for all applicants. A consistent and transparent timeline for application review could reduce stress for applicants, and knowing all the interview offers that will be extended might help applicants more efficiently decide which offer to accept.Some residency programs invite more applicants to interview than they have interviews available, meaning that applicants who do not schedule their interview immediately—often within minutes—may lose their opportunity to interview.15 The NRMP should require that programs participating in the Match offer no more interviews than they have available at any given time.Although the application process exists external to the Match, the NRMP should nonetheless encourage efforts to reduce application numbers by allowing more efficient means for programs to identify well-suited and interested applicants (and vice versa), such as preference signaling. The NRMP could insist that participating programs report their selection criteria in a standardized manner to prevent applicants from applying to programs where their application will not be seriously considered.Together, the NRMP, AAMC, and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education house much important data regarding efficiency and equity in the residency application process—but maintaining individual data silos prevents comprehensive analysis. The NRMP's plan to collect and report applicant demographics is a good first step.16 Improved data sharing and standardization of geographic and demographic terms among these organizations would be a useful second step to help applicants more judiciously rank programs to which they are well suited and have a good chance of receiving an interview and matching.The formation of the Match is a testament to the power of innovation to improve the residency selection process. But if the NRMP is to enjoy as much success in its next 70 years as it did in its first, it should draw on both its current position of power and the pioneering spirit that led to its creation.",Medical education; MEDLINE; Residency training; Data science; Medicine; Computer science; Family medicine; Political science; Continuing education; Law,,Humans; United States; Internship and Residency; School Admission Criteria; Career Choice,10.4300/jgme-d-22-00248.1,true

Although, a good fairness quotient is not meeting the required standards yet due to the limited privacy and inaccessibility of the network. We propose a robust encryption method to overcome the traditional terrestrial secure data sharing problems and approach the expected demands. Enabling cryptography in healthcare edge computing systems is a preliminary prerequisite, especially after integrating IoT framework in these ecosystems. Therefore, it is paramount to allow an indispensable tool for secure data exchange among digital devices embedded through the network. Therefore, we elaborate a privacy mechanism based on fundamental mathematics to transfer text information securely throughout our research work. Introducing an innovative cryptography technique that uses a novel category of matrix called circulant matrices aims to operate confidential transmission of text messages. In addition, we modified and integrated an archaic alphanumeric method called Gematria, which derives from the Greek word “geometria”, to assign numerical values to Latin letters.",Computer science; Encryption; Confidentiality; Cryptography; Alphanumeric; Computer security; Programming language,,,10.1109/camad52502.2021.9617795,false

Levine; Raquel G. Hernandez,"Introduction Difficult patient encounters (DPEs) are common and can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction among healthcare providers. Pediatric resident physician experiences with DPEs and curricula for enhancing necessary communication skills have not been well described. Materials and methods We used a cross-sectional survey research design for our needs assessment on resident experiences with DPEs. Thirty-three pediatric residents completed this anonymous survey. The survey assessed residents' experiences with and self-efficacy regarding DPEs. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the quantitative data. Additionally, two authors independently coded free response data to include in the narrative description of the survey results. Results These survey results include the views of 92% of the residents in the program (33/36). Residents reported a greater frequency of difficult encounters in the inpatient setting than the outpatient setting. The majority of residents rated their communication skills during DPEs as ""fair"" or ""good"" (70%, 23/33). Residents tended to have lower confidence when discussing chronic pain, managing parental insistence on a plan, and breaking bad news. They generally reported higher levels of anxiety for scenarios involving angry patients and families, families insisting on a plan, and when breaking bad news. Residents cited many challenges, including working with angry and demanding families. Additionally, residents described difficulty with managing discordant opinions between the family and the healthcare team regarding the care plan. Residents expressed a preference for learning how to manage challenging patient encounters using clinical experiences. Simulation, discussion, and observation of role models also rated highly as educational methods for increasing skills, while most residents rated lectures as the least important means of training skills for these difficult encounters. Discussion We found that pediatric residents experience difficult encounters frequently, especially in the inpatient setting. Individual residents vary in their confidence and anxiety levels with different types of difficult encounters and may benefit from not only general communication skills training, but also from targeted training to equip them for the particular contexts they find most challenging. Residents value interactive structured learning activities, including discussion and simulation. Residents most consistently value the opportunity to lead challenging conversations in the clinical setting, especially when followed by effective debriefing and feedback by trained faculty preceptors. Conclusions Next steps include creating a ""Difficult Encounters"" communication skills curriculum informed by this needs assessment, which aim to enhance patient care as well as increase resident self-efficacy. In addition to the curriculum development for residents, it may be helpful to initiate faculty development on how to supervise resident-led difficult conversations and provide effective debriefing and feedback to promote resident growth.",Health care; Debriefing; Faculty development; Curriculum development; Graduate medical education; Needs assessment; Communication skills training; Curriculum; Medical education; Medicine,communication skills training; curriculum development; difficult patient encounters; graduate medical education; needs assessment; pediatric residents; simulation,,10.7759/cureus.3340,true

However, limited research has focused on self-rated oral health among older patients attending tertiary dental care. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the potential factors associated with self-rated oral health among elderly patients attending a university dental hospital in Thailand.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""Methods"">This telephone-based cross-sectional study was carried out among elderly patients older than 60 years who attended at least one dental visit at the university dental hospital in 2020. Hospital numbers (HN) were used to identify eligible candidates for this study. We calculated the sample size by assuming a finite population of 70,028 elderly patients with valid telephone numbers. The minimum sample required for this study was 398 participants. Trained interviewers conducted telephone calls between July 2021 and January 2022 using the validated modified oral health questionnaire. Self-rated oral health was assessed using a conventionally used global oral health question: ""How would you describe your dental health?"" with three response options: good, fair, and poor. Descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact test, and binary logistic regression were performed to analyze the data.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""Results"">A total of 836 telephone numbers were called. There were 402 (48.10%) elderly patients who agreed to and completed the telephone interview. Most of the study participants were women (61.4%) between 61-74 years of age (83.1%) with a mean age of 69.18 years. Bivariate analyses showed associations between poor self-rated oral health and lower subjective oral functions: chewing discomfort (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and speaking discomfort (<i>p</i> = 0.013). However, the multivariate regression model indicated a significant association between poor self-rated oral health and chewing discomfort (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Therefore, elderly patients with chewing discomfort were more likely to perceive poor oral health.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""Conclusions"">These findings indicate that difficulty chewing could be a potential factor influencing self-rated adverse oral health among older patients attending the university dental hospital. Furthermore, our study adds that the predictive power of a single-item self-measurement supports its value as a standard measure to predict oral health risk in tertiary care institutions, as well as primary care settings and community-based survey research. Therefore, healthcare providers should routinely evaluate self-rated oral health among elderly patients to detect early signs and symptoms of oral health problems, assess the success of dental treatments, and monitor general health and well-being.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>©2022 Sermsuti-anuwat et al.</CopyrightInformation>",Medicine; Cross-sectional study; Logistic regression; Telephone interview; Oral health; Descriptive statistics; Family medicine; Population; Gerontology; Environmental health; Social science; Statistics; Mathematics; Pathology; Sociology; Internal medicine,Geriatric dentistry; Oral health; Oral health promotion; Self-rated oral health; Subjective oral functions,Humans; Female; Aged; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Oral Health; Thailand/epidemiology; Universities; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telephone; Hospitals,10.7717/peerj.14191,true

We determined healthcare providers' AMS attitudes, practices, and associated factors in selected health facilities in Uganda. We conducted a cross-sectional study among nurses, clinical officers, pharmacy technicians, medical officers, pharmacists, and medical specialists in 32 selected health facilities in Uganda. Data were collected once from each healthcare provider in the period from October 2019 to February 2020. Data were collected using an interview-administered questionnaire. AMS attitude and practice were analysed using descriptive statistics, where scores of AMS attitude and practices for healthcare providers were classified into high, fair, and low using a modified Blooms categorisation. Associations of AMS attitude and practice scores were determined using ordinal logistic regression. This study reported estimates of AMS attitude and practices, and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were reported. We adjusted for clustering at the health facility level using clustered robust standard errors. A total of 582 healthcare providers in 32 healthcare facilities were recruited into the study. More than half of the respondents (58%,340/582) had a high AMS attitude. Being a female (aOR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47-0.92, P < 0.016), having a bachelor's degree (aOR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.24-2.63, P < 0.002) or master's (aOR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.13-3.75, P < 0.018) were significant predictors of high AMS attitude.

The impact on healthcare and services to the patient is the nurses’ ability to create a friendly rapport with the patients. Yet, the majority in the rural Primary Health Care facilities are still facing many challenges in demonstrating patient-centeredness services to the community. Thus, the objective of this study is to explore and describe the factors influencing patient-centered care provision and nurses’ experience in Primary Health Care facilities. An exploratory qualitative approach with purposive sampling was used to gather data. Individual interviews with 35 nurses were conducted using a semi-structure interview guide question in the Primary Health Care settings in Nigeria. Each of the interviews with the nurses lasted for 25 minutes to one hour. All interviews were audio-taped, and transcribed verbatim using Microsoft Word. The transcripts were read and re-read, coded using NVivo version 12 software to organize the relevant information and categorized them into themes and sub-themes. Thematic analysis guided this study. The findings revealed three themes and sub-themes. The impact of environmental factors with two subthemes—suitable working environment and coordinated care; resources—shortage of staff and inadequate resources as sub-themes, and lastly, cultural sensitivity and religious influence—communication. Poor implementation of PCC strategies in most of the PHC facilities could lead to poor patient care and a lack of job satisfaction among nurses. This study identified that nurses have both negative and positive experience in providing patient-centered care health services. Providing patient-centered care in the Primary Health Care setting promotes the goal of achieving universal health coverage in Nigeria if the government would prioritize nurses’ pay, employ more staff, provide a conducive working environment, and opportunities for further training programs for nurses to enable and empower them with the necessary knowledge and skills. This, in turn, will translate into a range of outcomes that are socially valued, such as health responsiveness, health coverage and fairness.",Thematic analysis; Nursing; Nonprobability sampling; Health care; Qualitative research; Psychology; Medicine; Sociology; Political science; Social science; Population; Environmental health; Law,,,10.4236/ojn.2022.123014,true

Despite the efforts to combat burnout, the number of U.S. physicians who experience; burnout rose from 45 percent to over 50 percent between 2011 and 2014.; The purpose of this quality improvement evidence-based capstone project was to determine whether a physician wellness pilot; program could reduce and or eliminate burnout and stress for practicing physicians at an acute care healthcare institution; in the Chicago metropolitan area. The capstone project consisted of a pre-intervention survey, an intervention and a post; intervention survey. The participants targeted for this evidence-based project were practicing physicians in Illinois that span; across all specialty groups.; The physician burnout wellness pilot program was implemented during a two-week period of time during which participants; were provided with resources to reduce and or eliminate symptoms of burnout. The implementation of the physician wellness; pilot program capstone project showed the physicians at this organization were less stressed and more satisfied with their job; at (0.555) percent compared to pre intervention survey results that faired (0.77) and that of the national average of (0.80).; Additionally, the post intervention survey results showed the physicians at this organization are experiencing a lower level of; burnout (0.44) percent compared to pre intervention survey results that faired (0.53), but a higher level of burnout compared; to the national average (0.29).; Physician burnout is an epidemic that requires immediate attention because it not only effects the physicians, but it effects the; healthcare system. As such, regardless of the specialty and demographics of the physicians, organizations and physicians alike; must do their part in assessing if burnout exists. The findings showed the importance of physicians being able to recognize; the warning signs of burnout, encourage them to seek help when they are stressed, and take active steps towards ridding or; reducing burnout. The findings were compatible with evidence-based research that supports building physician resilience by; way of the development of a wellness program.; There is an alarmingly high prevalence of burnout amongst the working class in the United States. Strikingly it is even greater; for physicians, particularly the front-line practitioner’s family medicine, general internal medicine and emergency medicine; [2]. However, in recent years, the effect of burnout became even more evident when the increasing demand for doctors, coupled; with the rising rates of physician burnout, threatened many organizations abilities to consistently deliver quality care and; maintain a healthy physician workforce [3]. Consequently, burnout started to negatively impact health outcomes for both; physicians and the patients they serve. Since burnout affects doctors in both individual practices and hospitals across the; county, it is now viewed as a nationwide problem [4].; According to West, Dyrbye, Liselotte &amp; Shanafelt, rates of burnout symptoms associated with adverse effects on patients,; the healthcare workforce, costs, and physician health exceed 50% in studies of both physicians-in-training and practicing; physicians [5]. A survey presented by Medscape Physician Lifestyle in 2015 reported that the rate of burnout has increased; by 46 percent, which is double the rate of burnout in 2013 [6]. This data shows that the physician burnout rate is on the rise; and has increased significantly with every passing year [6].</jats:p>",Burnout; Depersonalization; Intervention (counseling); Specialty; Emotional exhaustion; Medicine; Nursing; Family medicine; Health care; Quality of life (healthcare); Clinical psychology; Economics; Economic growth,,,10.33140/jcrc.04.10.06,true

Nair; Rajesh Gupta; Sudeep Tanwar,"Demand forecasting, supply acquisition in healthcare supply chains are significant concerns spanning various organizations and bodies, rendering a crucial backbone to medical services necessary for everyday living. A global pandemic resulting in critical demand for medications and vaccines was an eye-opener in the current era. The intrinsic complexity among the bodies involved in the supply chain results in a lack of data transparency, security, privacy, and reliable communication. The counterfeited drug is an outcome of such limitations that adversely affects a global population. Consecutively, fair allocation and distribution of drugs and vaccines to administer them to a global mass equally is also a significant concern. Blockchain as technology grants an essential platform to track and manage transactions among communicating parties in the supply chain using a peer-to-peer, secured, distributed ledger, removing the need for intermediaries or entrusted third parties. Most existing studies focus on tracking and tracing supply chain systems in a centralized manner, leading to transparency, authenticity, data privacy, and authenticity concerns in healthcare supply chains. In this article, we propose a FAIR blockchain-based approach deploying smart contracts leading to transparent traceability of data and transactions in the healthcare supply chain between the communicating parties We propose an approach that allows fair allocation and distribution of vaccines as per the demand generated from the global population. We present a system architecture and algorithm representing the communication between parties that governs our proposed approach.

Population is 1.5 million with the majority living in urban areas. The main referral hospital is based on Unguja island and this is the only hospital with rheumatology care and where disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can be prescribed although there is no rheumatologist on either island. Healthcare is free for the population of Zanzibar. However, DMARD therapy is not included in the essential drugs list and patients incur significant out-of-pocket expenses when accessing care. A cost-effective analysis of DMARD therapy has not been performed. The aim of the project is to assess the efficacy of a basic healthcare package for this disease group to be included in the Zanzibar essential healthcare package. <h3>Methods</h3> From September 2019 and ongoing, all patients with a clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis were informed of the study and asked to participate. Patients were managed according to an internationally accepted pre-defined treatment guidelines. Data were collected on disease severity, medication used, quality of life scores using the EuroQol 5 dimensions-5 levels (EQ5D5L) questionnaire as well as income and expenditure for health. Data will be inputted in the Fair Choices tool developed by the Bergen Center for Ethics and Priority Settings (BCEPs) for calculations to determine the cost effectiveness of the package. <h3>Results</h3> Preliminary results show that increasing combination therapy coverage to 100% for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis with low-dose corticosteroids, folic acid supplementation, DMARDS (including methotrexate) was found to have an increased cost of USD 414,381. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality adjusted life year was 5.45 suggesting the package to be cost-effective. This would avert 76096 disease adjusted life years (DALYs). <h3>Discussion</h3> Preliminary analysis shows combined therapy for rheumatoid arthritis to be cost effective. To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to be undertaken in Zanzibar. Data collection is ongoing, and we hope to present more robust data from other parameters and a larger sample size at the time of the conference.",Medicine; Psoriatic arthritis; Ankylosing spondylitis; Rheumatoid arthritis; Referral; Health care; Population; Tanzania; Physical therapy; Quality of life (healthcare); Biosimilar; Rheumatology; Family medicine; Internal medicine; Environmental health; Nursing; Environmental science; Environmental planning; Economics; Economic growth,,,10.1136/bmjgh-2022-isph.106,true

However, the number of people who pass through European prisons each year is considerably higher. Due to infrastructural and population characteristics, individuals in contact with the criminal justice system face multiple and complex health care issues, including a higher prevalence of communicable diseases than the general population, and severe clinical outcomes when infected. The high turnover of people coming from the most disadvantaged segments of the population, together with the daily inflow/outflow of prison staff and facilities characterized by overcrowding, poor ventilation increase the risk of air-borne virus outbreaks. People living in prison are substantially more likely to experience drug-related problems than their peers in the community. Incarceration is associated with increases in blood-borne diseases-related risk behaviour among people who inject drugs. People living in prisons, because of the scarcity or lack of availability of needles, syringes and condoms, often share injecting equipment, tattooing and shaving materials, and practice unprotected sex. Individuals in contact with the criminal justice system often come from marginalized groups of society with a higher burden of poverty and discrimination, and with limited access to healthcare. Despite tailored preventive interventions should be implemented among vulnerable groups at the community level. Prisons can represent a point of access to integrated prison-community healthcare and social services. Delivering health protection and harm reduction programmes in prisons not only benefits the prison population but also has the potential to reduce the risk of transmission of some infectious diseases in the community, intervening earlier in the natural history of disease. The WHO has long supported the concept of prison health as an inseparable component of public health. However, a number of challenges hampers the successful implementation of such a concept, including the need for evidence-based decision making, inter-sectoral partnerships and adequate monitoring systems. Due to structural and operational reasons, conducting solid research and monitoring activities in prison settings is challenging and often available studies are mono-centric. This workshop will provide attendees with a comprehensive overview at European level of infectious diseases prevalence in prison populations and health services provided in detention facilities. The discussion of three European project collecting successful models of care for hepatitis elimination and implementation of vaccination services in prisons will create the context for an in-depth analysis of key challenges for prison health implementation and may help promote awareness that targeted interventions are feasible and effective in reducing infectious diseases burden among people living in prison and the community at large.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>;                <jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Key messages</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>• Existing European initiatives contribute to building the evidence for tailored prevention &amp; control interventions in prison settings.</jats:p>;                   <jats:p>• Adequate and effective prisons healthcare contribute to achieving the UN’s SDGs through improving health, reducing health inequalities and providing a fairer and safer society for all.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>",Prison; Overcrowding; Harm reduction; Population; Medicine; Criminal justice; Health care; Psychological intervention; Poverty; Environmental health; Public health; Nursing; Political science; Criminology; Psychology; Law,,,10.1093/eurpub/ckac129.384,true

In recent years steps have been taken to enhance the quality of their healthcare pages, such as the creation of the WikiProject Medicine initiative. In 2014 a partnership was formalised between Wikipedia and Cochrane Collaboration with similar aims. Three years ago, a group of medical students helped to formulate a protocol for the first ever randomised trial, whose aim was to test the value of Wikipedia in informing users about healthcare. <h3>Objectives</h3> To investigate the effects of adding high-grade quantitative evidence of outcomes of treatments into relevant Wikipedia pages on further information-seeking behaviour by the end-user. Methods: We randomised 70 Wikipedia pages, identified as highly relevant to up-to-date Cochrane Schizophrenia systematic reviews that contained a Summary of Findings table. Eligible Wikipedia pages in the intervention group (35) were seeded with tables listing best evidence of the effects of treatment, and hyperlinks to the source Cochrane review. Eligible pages in the control group (35) remained unchanged. <h3>Results</h3> The main outcome measures were routinely collected data on access to the full text and summary web page of the relevant Cochrane reviews (after 12 months). There was 100% follow-up of the 70 randomised pages. Six of the 35 in the intervention group had the tabular format deleted by other Wikipedia users during the course of the study, but all pages continued to report the same data within the text. The study found no evidence of significant effect on either of the co-primary outcomes: full text access adjusted ratio of geometric means 1.30, 95% CI: 0.71 to 2.38; page views 1.14, 95% CI: 0.6 to 2.13. Results were similar for all other outcomes, with the exception of Altmetric score for which there was evidence of clear effect (1.36, 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.78). <h3>Conclusions</h3> The pursuit of fair balance within Wikipedia healthcare pages is impressive and its reach unsurpassed. Enriching Wikipedia content is, potentially, a powerful way to improve health literacy among the public, and it is possible to test the effects of seeding pages with evidence. Though increased traffic to Cochrane reviews in the intervention group lacked statistical significance, there was nonetheless consistently an increase in all outcome measures. For every person that sought and clicked the reference on the ‘intervention’ Wikipedia page to seek more information (the primary outcome), many more are likely to have been informed by the page alone; the inclusion of high-quality data may have lessened the desire to click out to the original source. If demonstrated that the end-user becomes more informed as a result of such intervention, the potential as a tool for dissemination could be invaluable. Future studies should take such factors into consideration, and aim to replicate, expand and further develop our trial.

One such program is the public social healthcare protection schemes. However, like many other developing countries, Tanzania has low health insurance coverage, hindering its efforts to achieve universal health coverage. This study examines the role of equity in public social healthcare protection and its effects on household healthcare financing in Tanzania. The study used secondary data collected from the National Bureau of Statistics' National Panel Survey 2020/21 and stratified households based on their place of residence (rural vs. urban). Moreover, the logit regression model, ordered logit, and the endogenous switching regression model were used to provide counterfactual estimates without selection bias and endogeneity problems. The results showed greater variations in social health protection across rural and urban households, increasing disparities in health outcomes between these areas. Rural residents are the most vulnerable groups. Furthermore, education, income, and direct healthcare costs significantly influence equity in healthcare financing and the ability of households to benefit from public social healthcare protection schemes. To achieve equity in healthcare in rural and urban areas, developing countries need to increase investment in health sector by reducing the cost of healthcare, which will significantly reduce household healthcare financing. Furthermore, the study recommends that social health protection is an essential strategy for improving fair access to quality healthcare by removing differences across households and promoting equality in utilizing healthcare services.",,Developing countries; Endogenous switching regression; Health economics; Health equity; Health financing; Instrumental variable poisson; Tanzania,"Humans; Healthcare Financing; Tanzania; Health Care Costs; Healthcare Disparities; Family Characteristics; Insurance, Health; Health Expenditures",10.1186/s12939-023-01855-0,true

I discuss clinical interventions that can address the immediate concern of the clinician in a bio-psycho-social framework, and the value of considering eco-social and structural influences that can hinder recovery and perpetuate inequalities. Refugees face multiple adversities before, during and after escaping from life-threatening situations, political violence, torture and persecution. They present with complex health needs and encounter hostility from host countries and public services, which see their needs as an additional demand on the public purse. Regrettably, existing care practice and training of professionals do not often include skills for working across cultures, including cultural formulations and fair assessment, cultural adaptation of interventions, cultural competence and cultural consultation methods, including clinical ethnography and exploration of cultural identity and explanatory models. There are little data on effective and kind models of interpretation and translation. Care systems are rarely designed to fully address the needs of refugees. Health practitioners are not trained to address structural and institutional racism and discrimination, which leads to exclusion of the most marginalised, with little attention to social justice and fair processes as part of appropriate healthcare.",Refugee; Cultural competence; Mental health; Cultural humility; Psychological intervention; Psychology; Health care; Public relations; Public health; Racism; Nursing; Social psychology; Criminology; Medicine; Political science; Sociology; Psychiatry; Gender studies; Pedagogy; Law,Refugee; culture; eco-social; ethnography; mental health,,10.1192/bjo.2022.11,true

DiTosto; Kai Holder; Elizabeth Soyemi; Molly Beestrum; Lynn M. Yee,"OBJECTIVE Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the published literature on housing instability during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes and perinatal healthcare utilization. DATA SOURCES We performed a systematic search in November 2020 using Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus using terms related to housing instability during pregnancy, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and perinatal healthcare utilization. The search was limited to the United States. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Studies examining housing instability (including homelessness) during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes (including preterm birth, low birthweight neonates, and maternal morbidity) and perinatal healthcare utilization were included. METHODS Two authors screened abstracts and full-length articles for inclusion. The final cohort consisted of 14 studies. Two authors independently extracted data from each article and assessed the study quality using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool. Risk of bias was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Study Quality Assessment Tools. RESULTS All included studies were observational, including retrospective cohort (n=10, 71.4%), cross-sectional observational (n=3, 21.4%), or prospective cohort studies (n=1, 7.1%). There was significant heterogeneity in the definitions of housing instability and homelessness. Most of the studies only examined homelessness (n=9, 64.3%) and not lesser degrees of housing instability. Housing instability and homelessness during pregnancy were significantly associated with preterm birth, low birthweight neonates, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and delivery complications. Among studies examining perinatal healthcare utilization, housing instability was associated with inadequate prenatal care and increased hospital utilization. All studies exhibited moderate, low, or very low study quality and fair or poor internal validity. CONCLUSION Although data on housing instability during pregnancy are limited by the lack of a standardized definition, a consistent relationship between housing instability and adverse pregnancy outcomes has been suggested by this systematic review. The evaluation and development of a standardized definition and measurement of housing instability among pregnant individuals is warranted to address future interventions targeted to housing instability during pregnancy.",Retrospective cohort study; Prospective cohort study; Emergency medicine; Observational study; Prenatal care; Cochrane Library; Pregnancy; MEDLINE; Medicine; Cohort,adverse perinatal outcomes; healthcare utilization; homelessness; housing instability; social determinants of health; systematic review,"Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Housing; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Premature Birth/epidemiology; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; United States",10.1016/j.ajogmf.2021.100477,true

As establishing a new digital service area within the solidarity-based insurance system implies several administrative and regulatory challenges, this paper aims to describe the legal framework for DiGA market access and pricing as well as the status quo of the DiGA market. Furthermore, we provide a basic approach to deriving value-based DiGA prices.To become eligible for reimbursement, the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices evaluates the compliance of a DiGA with general requirements (e.g., safety and data protection) and its positive healthcare effects (i.e., medical benefit or improvements of care structure and processes) in a fast-track process. Manufacturers may provide evidence for the benefits of their DiGA either directly with the application for the fast-track process or generate it during a trial phase that includes temporary reimbursement. After one year of \]reimbursement, the freely-set manufacturer price is replaced by a price negotiated between the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds and the manufacturer. By February 2022, 30 DiGA had successfully completed the fast-track process. 73% make use of the trial phase and have not yet proven their benefit. Given this dynamic growth of the DiGA market and the low minimum evidence standards, fair pricing remains the central point of contention. The regulatory framework makes the patient-relevant benefits of a DiGA a pricing criterion to be considered in particular. Yet, it does not indicate how the benefits of a DiGA should be translated into a reasonable price. Our evidence-based approach to value-based DiGA pricing approximates the SHI's willingness to pay by the average cost-effectiveness of one or more established therapy in a field of indication and furthermore considers the positive healthcare effects of a DiGA.The proposed approach can be fitted into DiGA pricing processes under the given regulatory framework and can provide objective guidance for price negotiations. However, it is only one piece of the pricing puzzle, and numerous methodological and procedural issues related to DiGA pricing are still open. Thus, it remains to be seen to what extent DiGA prices will follow the premise of value-based pricing.",Reimbursement; Health care; Business; Economics; Economic growth,DiGA; Digital health applications; Fast-track process; Market access; Statutory health insurance; Value-based pricing; eHealth,,10.1186/s12962-022-00359-y,true

The condition gets worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic back in 2020. Private healthcare has reported high staff turnover and caused higher costs to the business which in terms of direct financial losses and lack of continued care. The aims of this study are to identify the root causes of the high resignation rate in private healthcare. Five key factors (job satisfaction, work environment, compensation and benefits, work-life balance and employee recognition) were successfully identified and measured as significant contributors towards employee retention of selected private healthcare in Malaysia. A quantitative study was conducted via survey for obtaining primary data and information needed. There were 123 respondents and data were collected from the selected private hospitals in Sarawak, Malaysia. Based on rigorous reviewing of the literature, instrument designing and subsequent pilot testing, the study identified six (6) hypotheses which are tested using statistical technique SPSS version 26. The outcome revealed that employee recognition, with the unstandardized coefficients Beta value of 0.359 followed by job satisfaction with a Beta value of 0.295 was a supported and stronger predictor in influencing employees’ retention in the private hospitals. Other determinants like working environment, compensation and benefits and work-life balance were not strongly supported however been highlighted by respondents as important factors too.

Methods: We utilized the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (SEER) and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey data linkage from 2000-2019. 19,017 female breast cancer survivors aged ≥65 years at survey with a prior diagnosis of primary invasive breast cancer were included. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression to determine the relationship between race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white [NHW; referent], non-Hispanic Black [NHB], non-Hispanic Asian [NHA], Hispanic) and perceived quality of survivorship care (excellent in Getting Care Quickly, Getting Needed Care, Physician Communication, Getting Needed Prescription Drugs, and Overall Care, Health Plan, and Physician ratings), and usually/always having Enough Time with Physician, overall and by perceived general health status (excellent/very good, good, fair/poor). Results: Most survivors were NHW (78.1%) while the minority were NHB (8.1%), NHA (6.5%), or Hispanic (6.2%). Survivors reported an average of 76.3 years at survey (SD=7.14) and 4.65 years (SD=3.51) since diagnosis. Overall, NHB survivors were significantly less likely to report excellent for Overall Care (aOR, 0.80, 95% CI, 0.71-0.91) and usually/always having Enough Time with Physician (aOR, 0.74, 95% CI, 0.58-0.93) compared to NHW survivors. NHA survivors were significantly less likely to report excellent Getting Care Quickly (aOR, 0.75, 95% CI, 0.63-0.88), Getting Needed Care (aOR, 0.79, 95% CI, 0.63-0.99), Physician Communication (aOR, 0.84, 95% CI, 0.73-0.97), and Overall Care rating (aOR, 0.76, 95% CI, 0.67-0.87) compared to NHW survivors. The aORs for Hispanic survivors varied depending on outcome. When stratified by general health status, NHB compared to NHW survivors were significantly more likely (aOR, 1.30, 95% CI, 1.05-1.62) to report excellent in Getting Needed Care among those who reported good general health, but this disparity was not observed among those who reported excellent/very good general health (p-interaction=0.04). Compared to NHW survivors, NHB were significantly more likely (aOR, 1.54, 95% CI, 1.14-2.08) to report excellent Health Plan ratings among those who reported excellent/very good general health but not among those who reported good (p-interaction=0.03) or fair/poor general health (p-interaction=0.01). There were no significant interactions between general health status and NHA or Hispanic group for any outcome. Conclusion: These findings can be used to inform future interventions, care, and physician education throughout breast cancer survivorship.</jats:p>;                <jats:p>Citation Format: Kate E.

Their understanding of everyday texts is limited, which prevents them from taking an active role in society and making informed decisions regarding healthcare, legal representation, or democratic choice. Lexical simplification is a natural language processing task that aims to make text understandable to everyone by replacing complex vocabulary and expressions with simpler ones, while preserving the original meaning. It has attracted considerable attention in the last 20 years, and fully automatic lexical simplification systems have been proposed for various languages. The main obstacle for the progress of the field is the absence of high-quality datasets for building and evaluating lexical simplification systems. In this study, we present a new benchmark dataset for lexical simplification in English, Spanish, and (Brazilian) Portuguese, and provide details about data selection and annotation procedures, to enable compilation of comparable datasets in other languages and domains. As the first multilingual lexical simplification dataset, where instances in all three languages were selected and annotated using comparable procedures, this is the first dataset that offers a direct comparison of lexical simplification systems for three languages. To showcase the usability of the dataset, we adapt two state-of-the-art lexical simplification systems with differing architectures (neural vs. non-neural) to all three languages (English, Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese) and evaluate their performances on our new dataset. For a fairer comparison, we use several evaluation measures which capture varied aspects of the systems' efficacy, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We find that a state-of-the-art neural lexical simplification system outperforms a state-of-the-art non-neural lexical simplification system in all three languages, according to all evaluation measures. More importantly, we find that the state-of-the-art neural lexical simplification systems perform significantly better for English than for Spanish and Portuguese, thus posing a question if such an architecture can be used for successful lexical simplification in other languages, especially the low-resourced ones.",Computer science; Natural language processing; Portuguese; Artificial intelligence; Vocabulary; Lexical database; Task (project management); Lexical item; Brazilian Portuguese; Benchmark (surveying); Usability; Selection (genetic algorithm); Meaning (existential); Linguistics; WordNet; Human–computer interaction; Psychology; Philosophy; Management; Geodesy; Economics; Psychotherapist; Geography,artificial intelligence for social good; benchmark datasets; evaluation methodologies; lexical simplification; low-resource tasks; natural language processing,,10.3389/frai.2022.991242,true

Machine learning (ML) represents a distinct application of AI, which is capable of generating predictions and has already been tested in different medical specialties with various approaches such as diagnostic applications, cost predictions or identification of risk factors. In orthopaedics, this technology has only recently been introduced and the literature on ML in knee arthroplasty is scarce. In this review, we aim to investigate which predictions are already feasible using ML models in knee arthroplasty to identify prerequisites for the effective use of this novel approach. For this reason, we conducted a systematic review of ML algorithms for outcome prediction in knee arthroplasty.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">A comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline database and the Cochrane Library was conducted to find ML applications for knee arthroplasty. All relevant articles were systematically retrieved and evaluated by an orthopaedic surgeon and a data scientist on the basis of the PRISMA statement. The search strategy yielded 225 articles of which 19 were finally assessed as eligible. A modified Coleman Methodology Score (mCMS) was applied to account for a methodological evaluation.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The studies presented in this review demonstrated fair to good results (AUC median 0.76/range 0.57-0.98), while heterogeneous prediction models were analysed: complications (6), costs (4), functional outcome (3), revision (2), postoperative satisfaction (2), surgical technique (1) and biomechanical properties (1) were investigated.

142-191-919-185-578,Comparing Behavioral Health Outcomes and Treatment Utilization of Those With and Without Justice Involvement Within the Past Year Among American Indian and Alaska Native Adults.,2023,journal article,Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,United States,Tanya Renn; John Moore; Katie A Schultz; Christopher A Veeh,"Similar to other populations, worse health, increased emergency healthcare utilization, and heightened substance misuse are correlated with higher justice involvement among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations. The historical context and resulting contemporary injustices for AI/AN populations have directly contributed to higher rates of these health and behavioral health conditions among this population. As a result, AI/AN individuals have disproportionate rates of incarceration in the USA, with young AI/AN males having the highest odds of incarceration when compared to any other group. American Indian and Alaska Native populations are overrepresented in the criminal justice system across different touchpoints. However, there remains a scarcity of data and research on AI/AN peoples' involvement with the justice system, and what their lives look like prior to, during, and after justice involvement. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by exploring rates of substance use and mental health diagnoses and treatment utilization among justice-involved and non-justice-involved AI/AN samples. Further, we examined correlates associated with past-year service utilization. Data from the 2015-2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N = 214,505 adults aged 18+) was used. For this study, we examined a subsample of 3068 AI/AN adults. Quantitative data analyses using STATA 16 were run to test for differences on service utilization, mental health status, and substance misuse between AI/AN non-justice-involved and justice-involved samples. Among adults in the sample, 446 (15%) reported justice involvement in the past year. Justice-involved AI/AN individuals were significantly more likely to use the emergency department, utilize mental health treatment, and access substance use treatment in the past year. Additionally, justice-involved AI/AN individuals reported significantly higher rates of mental illness and past-year substance use disorder. In regression models, justice involvement was significantly associated with past-year substance use treatment and past-year mental health treatment. The findings from this work highlight the differences among substance use, mental illness, and treatment utilization between justice-involved and non-justice-involved AI/AN individuals. Findings suggest that justice-involved individuals fair worse in all areas and argue for the consideration of interventions that incorporate both culturally sensitive and justice-responsive models to improve the behavioral health outcomes of these populations. Lastly, while justice-involved AI/AN populations utilize treatment services at higher and disproportionate levels, there is reason to believe that there continues to be a mismatch of need and utilization and further exploration is warranted.",,Criminal justice involvement; Indigenous; Mental health; Service utilization; Substance misuse,,10.1007/s40615-023-01552-2,false

We estimated the prevalence and risk factors for COVID-19 among HCWs in Bangkok, Thailand. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a large tertiary care academic hospital in Thailand from May 2020 to May 2021. HCWs that presented with fever and/or acute respiratory tract symptoms who tested with RT-PCR were identified, and their clinical data were collected. There were 1432 HCWs with fever and/or acute respiratory tract symptoms during May 2020 and May 2021. A total of 167 patients were front-line HCWs and 1265 were non-front-line HCWs. Sixty HCWs (4.2%) developed COVID-19; 2 were front-line and 58 were non-front-line HCWs. The prevalence of COVID-19 in front-line HCWs was 1.7% (2/167), and 4.6% (58/1265) in non-front-line HCWs (P = .04). In addition, non-front-line HCWs, non-medical staffs, history of contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case at home/family, unvaccinated status, fair compliance to personal protective equipment (PPE) standard, and initial presentation with pneumonia were significantly more common in HCWs with COVID-19 than those without COVID-19 (P < .05). Front-line HCWs, history of contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case at the clinical care areas in the hospital, vaccinated status, good compliance to PPE standards, and initial presentation with upper respiratory infection were significantly more common in HCWs without COVID-19 than those with COVID-19 (P < .05). Multivariate analysis revealed history of exposure with confirmed COVID-19 case at home or in family, unvaccinated status, non-frontline-HCWs, non-medical staffs, and fair compliance to PPE standard to be independent factors associated with COVID-19 in HCWs.

Holm; Terje Andreas Mathisen; Torill Sæterstrand; Berit Støre Brinchmann,"In Norway, elder care is primarily a municipal responsibility. Municipal health services strive to offer the ‘lowest level of effective care,’ and home healthcare services are defined as the lowest level of care in Norway. Municipalities determine the type(s) of service and the amount of care applicants require. The services granted are outlined in an individual decision letter, which serves as a contract between the municipality and the home healthcare recipient. The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the scope and duration of home healthcare services allocated by municipalities and to determine where home care recipients live in relation to home healthcare service offices. A document analysis was performed on data derived from 833 letters to individuals allocated home care services in two municipalities in Northern Norway (Municipality A = 500 recipients, Municipality B = 333 recipients). In Municipality A, 74% of service hours were allotted to home health nursing, 12% to practical assistance, and 14% to support contact; in Municipality B, the distribution was 73%, 19%, and 8%, respectively. Both municipalities allocated home health services with no service end date (41% and 85% of the total services, respectively). Among recipients of “expired” services, 25% in Municipality A and 7% in Municipality B continued to receive assistance. Our findings reveal that the municipalities adhered to the goal for home care recipients to remain at home as long as possible before moving into a nursing home. The findings also indicate that the system for allocating home healthcare services may not be fair, as the municipalities lacked procedures for revising individual decisions. Our findings indicate that local authorities should closely examine how they design individual decisions and increase their awareness of how long a service should be provided.",Health administration; Public health; Health informatics; Nursing; Health care; Home health nursing; Service (business); Nursing research; Duration (project management); Medicine,Aging; Community; Healthcare delivery; Home health nursing; Practical assistance; Support contact,"Aged, 80 and over; Cities/statistics & numerical data; Delivery of Health Care/standards; Female; Health Care Rationing/organization & administration; Health Services for the Aged/supply & distribution; Home Care Services/supply & distribution; House Calls/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data; Male; Norway; Residence Characteristics/statistics & numerical data; Retrospective Studies; Social Support",10.1186/s12913-017-2623-3,true

Iranian Social Security Organization (ISSO) is a non-governmental organization responsible for providing medical services to insured individuals in 77 hospitals, 265 polyclinics, and clinics that has faced much demand from the insured to build a new medical center. So, Due to the significant role of ISSO in meeting the medical needs and its high coverage (almost 42%) in Iran, we aimed to identify the factors influencing medical facilities' fair distribution in the ISSO. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> This applied study was conducted as a descriptive study in the ISSO in 2018. Variables affecting medical facilities distribution were elicited from the literature review and through an interview with 16 experts who were occupied in the healthcare management field. Then, a Likert scale-based questionnaire with 56 items in 7 sections was developed. Questionnaires were distributed among 456 person received questionnaires, and 415 responded to all questions. All participants were experts in the healthcare section of the ISSO all over the country. Data were analyzed via exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and structural equations using SPSS 23 and AMOS-24 software. <b>Results:</b> By exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, seven main factors (demographic factors, geographical factors, functional factors, structural factors, humanistic factors, economic factors, and Contract parties factors) were identified as critical factors affecting medical facilities distribution. Each aspect included many components. AMOS software showed the significance of variables by P-value and critical ratio (CR) indices to analyze the conceptual model of the research. Function factors with standard coefficients of 0.85 had the most, and economic factors with a standard coefficient of 0.53 had a minor effect on the distribution of medical facilities in the ISSO. <b>Conclusion:</b> To have a more efficient medical facilities distribution in the ISSO must consider all identified factors, special attention should be given to the maximum use of available medical facilities.

This represents an opportunity to build reliable evidence to underpin such policies when they are eventually developed. Representing the interests of those with the experience of living with the condition in national diabetes policies is important, particularly the interests regarding medicine access, a key pillar in diabetes management. One way to achieve this representation is to publish patient perceptions. Patient perspectives are especially valuable in the context of diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa, where much of the empirical work has focused on clinical and epidemiological questions. We therefore captured the challenges and suggestions around medicine access articulated by a population of diabetes patients and their caregivers. This was a qualitative interpretivist study based on data from focus group discussions with adult diabetes patients and their caregivers. Eight FGDs of 4-13 participants each whose duration averaged 13.35 minutes were conducted. Participants were recruited from diabetes outpatient clinics at two health facilities in Harare. One site was Parirenyatwa Hospital, the largest public referral and teaching hospital in Zimbabwe. The other was a private for-profit facility. Ethics approval was granted by the Joint Research Ethics Committee for University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences and the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals (Ref: JREC 295/18). Diabetes patients and their caregivers are interested in affordable access to medicines of acceptable form and quality with minimum effort. Yet, they often find themselves privileging one dimension of access over another e.g. prioritising affordability over acceptability. Based on participants' articulations, a sound diabetes policy should: 1. provide for financial and consumer protections, 2. regulate healthcare business practices and medicine prices, 3. provide for a responsive health workforce attentive to patient problems, 4. accord the same importance to diabetes that is accorded to communicable diseases, 5. decentralize diabetes management to lower levels of care, 6. limit wastage, corruption, bad macro-financial governance and a lack of transparency about how funding for health is used, and 7. provide support to strengthen patients' and caregivers' psychosocial networks. A diabetes policy acceptable to patients is one infused with principles of good governance, fairness, inclusiveness and humanity; characterised by: financial protection and price regulation, consumer protection, equity in the attention accorded to different diseases, decentralized service delivery, inclusion of patient voice in political decision-making, a responsive compassionate health workforce, psychosocial support for patients and their caregivers and allocative efficiency and transparency in public expenditure.",Medicine; Family medicine; Focus group; Qualitative research; Population; Context (archaeology); Health care; Diabetes mellitus; Referral; Nursing; Gerontology; Political science; Environmental health; Business; Sociology; Paleontology; Social science; Marketing; Law; Biology; Endocrinology,,,10.1371/journal.pgph.0000255,true

In addition, women who had the support of close family members and their peers are more likely to compete and rise to leadership positions. Furthermore, women who received organizational support in the form of affirmative action, training, development, and recognition also tended to rise to leadership positions. However, women who assumed leadership positions but whose day-to-day decision-making was influenced by their supervisors, those who had experienced sexual harassment, and those under the influence of societal norms were less likely to attain leadership positions.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The opinions and experiences of female health leaders revealed that individual behaiour whileassumming a leadership positon, empathy, and wise resource management positivey influence their career development. In addition, female health workers who had support form close family members and peers strived for growth to leadership positions. Furthermore, the presence of organizational support, in the form of affirmative actions, and succession planning were another opportunity for females in their career paths. Conversely, some social norms were found to deter female health workers from advanicing to leadership positions. Therefore, enhancing the leadership capacity of women and improving social and organizational support is recommended. In addition, addressing the low level of self-image among women and patriarchal societal norms at the community level is recommended.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2022.

Access to and delivery of rehabilitation care were severely disrupted, and patients have faced several challenges during the COVID-19 outbreak (3). These challenges include addressing new functional impairments faced by survivors of COVID-19 and infection prevention to avoid the virus spreading to healthcare workers and other patients not infected with COVID-19 (4-7). In this scoping review, we aimed to develop rehabilitation recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic across the continuum of rehabilitation care. <h3>Data Sources</h3> Established frameworks were used to guide the scoping review methodology. Medline, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL databases from inception to August 1, 2020, and prominent rehabilitation organizations' websites were searched. <h3>Study Selection</h3> We included articles and reports if they were focused on rehabilitation recommendations for COVID-19 survivors or the general population at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. <h3>Data Extraction</h3> Two team members used a pre-tested Data Extraction form to extract data from included full-text articles. The strength and the quality of the extracted recommendations were evaluated by two reviewers using the GRADE approach. <h3>Data Synthesis</h3> We retrieved 6,468 citations, of which 2,086 were eligible after removing duplicates. We excluded 1,980 citations based on the title and the abstract. Of the full-text articles screened, we included 106 studies. We presented recommendations based on the patient journey at the time of the pandemic. We assessed the evidence to be of overall fair quality and strong for the recommendations. <h3>Conclusions</h3> We have combined the latest research results and accumulated expert opinions on rehabilitation to develop acute and post-acute rehabilitation recommendations in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Further and ongoing updates are warranted in order to incorporate the emerging evidence into rehabilitation guidelines. <h3>Author(s) Disclosures</h3> This symposium is sponsored by the COVID-19 and Frailty Task Force from the Aging Research and Geriatric Rehabilitation Networking Groups.",CINAHL; Rehabilitation; Data extraction; Pandemic; Medicine; MEDLINE; Health care; Population; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Physical therapy; Family medicine; Disease; Nursing; Psychological intervention; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Environmental health; Pathology; Economic growth; Political science; Law; Economics,,,10.1016/j.apmr.2022.08.021,true

Community-based drop-in centres (66%) was the preferred PrEP outlet for AGYW compared with public clinics (25%) and private clinics (9%). Most men preferred community-based delivery models. Among individuals who initiated PrEP, 50% were men, 62% were &lt;35 years old and 97% were tested at health fairs compared with home testing. Integrated antiretroviral therapy (ART)-PrEP delivery was favoured among serodiscordant couples with 82.9% of couples using PrEP or ART with no HIV seroconversions. PrEP initiation within healthcare facilities was increased by perceived client-friendly services and non-judgemental healthcare workers. Barriers to PrEP initiation included distance to travel to and time spent at health facilities and perceived community stigma. PrEP SDMs for AGYW and men need to be tailored to the needs and preferences for each group. Programme implementers should promote community-based SDMs to increase PrEP initiation among AGYW and men.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

A good practice of hand hygiene reduces the incidence of these nosocomial infections. There is a dearth of precise data about the awareness of hand hygiene practice amongst Ophthalmologists in India.  Aim: To assess the knowledge of hand hygiene amongst the Ophthalmologists and trainees in Uttarakhand and surrounding regions of Northern India.  Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted by Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences , Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India amongst Ophthalmologists attending a three days long annual ophthalmology conference in Uttarakhand in October 2019, after taking due approval from the Ethics Committee of the Institute. All the 150 participants which were included in the study filled the World Health Organisation (WHO) hand hygiene questionnaire comprising of 10 multiple-choice questions. The respondents were asked to tick the most appropriate choices and scores were given out of a maximum score of 25. Mann Whitney test was used for statistical analysis in the study.  Results: A total of 150 subjects participated in the survey among which 70 were females and 80 were males. Of all, 60% of the participants were practicing surgeons while 60 (40%) were postgraduate students. About 126 (84%) reported having received a formal training on hand hygiene. Hands of the health care workers were reported to be the commonest route of cross transmission of germs between the patients and healthcare facilities. The average total score of the participants in the survey was 16 (64%) and there was no significant difference between the scores of participants based on gender and training.  Conclusion: The study shows that majority of the Ophthalmologists have formal training and fair knowledge on the basics of hand hygiene, but lacked the in-depth knowledge, which needs to be addressed in order to reduce the incidence of hospital acquired infections.</jats:p>",Cross-sectional study; Hygiene; Optometry; Medicine; Environmental health; Family medicine; Pathology,,,10.7860/jcdr/2022/53022.16765,true

DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey. METHODS: This study was conducted on 317 inpatient ward nurses of six teaching hospitals in Tehran, Iran during 1 September 2017-14 November 2018. Clinical nurses were recruited by a multistage random sampling. Data were collected using structured questionnaires of organizational justice, job satisfaction, and nurses' intention to leave. Data were analysed by structural equation modelling using Amos 22 statistical program. RESULTS: The structural equation model demonstrated adequate fit and the hypothesized correlations were partially supported. The findings suggested that the distributive justice (p < .001; s = 0.24) and interactional justice (p < .001; s = 0.44) could indirectly affect the nurses' intention to leave the nursing profession via the direct impact on job satisfaction, while job satisfaction had a significant, negative effect on the nurses' intention to leave (p < .001; s = -0.71). CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, the model fit was acceptable, suggesting the validity of the final model. Furthermore, distributive and interactional justice could reduce the intention to leave the nursing profession by influencing the job satisfaction of the clinical nurses. IMPACT: This was one of the first studies to determine the aspects of justice that must be further emphasized by healthcare managers to increase the job satisfaction of nurses and their retention in healthcare systems.

Exponential breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and machine intelligence technologies could pave the way for identifying challenges afflicting the healthcare industry. Genomics is paving the way for predicting future illnesses, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. Machine learning advancements have expedited the pace of biomedical informatics research and inspired new branches of computational biology. Furthermore, knowing gene relationships has resulted in developing more accurate models that can effectively detect patterns in vast volumes of data, making classification models important in various domains. Recurrent Neural Network models have a memory that allows them to quickly remember knowledge from previous cycles and process genetic data. The present work focuses on type 2 diabetes prediction using gene sequences derived from genomic DNA fragments through automated feature selection and feature extraction procedures for matching gene patterns with training data. The suggested model was tested using tabular data to predict type 2 diabetes based on several parameters. The performance of neural networks incorporating Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) components, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) was tested in this research. The model's efficiency is assessed using the evaluation metrics such as Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, F1-Score, and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The suggested technique predicted future illnesses with fair Accuracy. Furthermore, our research showed that the suggested model could be used in real-world scenarios and that input risk variables from an end-user Android application could be kept and evaluated on a secure remote server.",Computer science; Recurrent neural network; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Artificial neural network; Informatics; Data mining; Engineering; Electrical engineering,PIMA dataset; Recurrent Neural Networks; Type-2 diabetes; deep learning; weight optimization,,10.3390/diagnostics12123067,true

A 2021 joint statement from the editors of 230 healthcare journals summoned health professionals to champion a “sustainable, fairer, resilient, and healthier world”. Despite calls for integrating climate change into medical education, few resources exist to guide curricular development. Illness scripts are an educational tool known to improve clinical reasoning and the application of new knowledge. <h3>OBJECTIVE:</h3> A series of interactive workshop sessions was developed by a multi-institutional working group in San Diego, CA using the 9illness scripts9 framework to better educate Family Medicine residents about common medical conditions adversely impacted by extreme weather conditions. <h3>STUDY DESIGN:</h3> Multi-institutional survey study. <h3>POPULATION STUDIED:</h3> Residents in all 4 Family Medicine residency programs in San Diego, CA. <h3>INTERVENTION:</h3> An inaugural multi-residency 3.5 hour educational symposium, held in April 2022, consisted of breakout sessions on updating climate-centric 9illness scripts9 and plenary sessions about advocacy and plant forward nutrition. <h3>OUTCOME MEASURES:</h3> Participants were asked to complete a brief survey with a QR code on their mobile devices and were asked questions about demographics, career plans, and self-reported confidence (answered on a 7-point Likert scale) in climate-focused patient counseling for common medical scenarios. Data was analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test by ranks analysis. <h3>RESULTS:</h3> 77 residents attended the symposium, of which 60% (46/79) completed the pretest and 38% (29/77) completed the posttest. Mean survey scores (pre;post) measuring participants9 self-confidence in undertaking advocacy efforts (2.78;5.07) and discussing health impacts of extreme weather on cardiac (2.13;5.17), respiratory (2.47;5.41), psychiatric (2.50;5.17) and obstetric (2.13;5.41) conditions were all statistically significant at p&lt;0.001. Residents were also asked “During times of extreme weather how often do you anticipate discussing medication dose adjustments” with 90% responding ‘&lt;10% of the time’ on the pretest but 40% responding ‘&gt;50% of the time’ on the posttest. <h3>CONCLUSION:</h3> A multi-residency symposium leveraging the collective expertise of local resources and application of illness scripts theory is a promising strategy for improving education and care delivery for common medical conditions adversely affected by climate change.",Context (archaeology); Equity (law); Graduate medical education; Medical education; Family medicine; Likert scale; Population; Psychology; Medicine; Geography; Environmental health; Political science; Law; Developmental psychology; Archaeology; Accreditation,,,10.1370/afm.21.s1.4300,false

A qualitative approach was used to explore access to, and uptake of, voluntary medical male circumcision for HIV prevention. Penchansky and Thomas’ Theory of Access was used as the analytical framework underpinning the study. The data were collected using key-informant interviews with purposively selected teachers and healthcare workers and focus-group discussions with secondary school learners. The data were thematically analysed using the NVivo software program. The findings suggest high levels of availability, accessibility and acceptability of voluntary medical male circumcision among learners. The learners indicated that access to voluntary medical male circumcision was fair. The most compelling benefit was its perceived protective efficacy against the transmission of HIV and AIDS among heterosexual partners. More centres for voluntary medical male circumcision were advocated to increase the accessibility of voluntary medical male circumcision services. However, an increased uptake was not guaranteed because several critical areas still needed attention, particularly from a policy perspective. We recommend the alignment of legal and policy frameworks to ensure that voluntary medical male circumcision is offered comprehensively.

The social meanings attached to masks may influence their use, but remain underinvestigated. Methods We systematically searched eight databases for studies containing qualitative data on public mask use during past epidemics, and used meta-ethnography to explore their social meanings. We compared key concepts within and across studies, then jointly wrote a critical synthesis. Results We found nine studies from China (n=5), Japan (n=1), Mexico (n=1), South Africa (n=1) and the USA (n=1). All studies describing routine mask use during epidemics were from East Asia. Participants identified masks as symbols of solidarity, civic responsibility and an allegiance to science. This effect was amplified by heightened risk perception (eg, during SARS in 2003), and by seeing masks on political leaders and in outdoor public spaces. Masks also acted as containment devices to manage threats to identity at personal and collective levels. In China and Japan, public and corporate campaigns framed routine mask use as individual responsibility for disease prevention in return for state- or corporate-sponsored healthcare access. In most studies, mask use waned as risk perception fell. In contexts where masks were mostly worn by patients with specific diseases (eg, for patients with tuberculosis in South Africa), or when trust in government was low (eg, during H1N1 in Mexico), participants described masks as stigmatising, uncomfortable or oppressive. Conclusion Face masks can take on positive social meanings linked to solidarity and altruism during epidemics. Unfortunately, these positive meanings can fail to take hold when risk perception falls, rules are seen as complex or unfair, and trust in government is low. At such times, ensuring continued use is likely to require additional efforts to promote locally appropriate positive social meanings, simplifying rules for use and ensuring fair enforcement.",Moral responsibility; Government; Risk perception; Political science; Qualitative research; Solidarity; Public relations; Altruism; Qualitative property; Politics,health policy; public health; qualitative study; respiratory infections,Altruism; COVID-19/ethnology; Humans; Masks; Qualitative Research; SARS-CoV-2; Social Norms,10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004068,true

163-285-545-515-315,A Study of Awareness about Biomedical Waste Management among Health Care Personnel,2022,journal article,Asian Journal of Management,A and V Publications,,Anil K Agarwal; Abhishek Yadav; Chandrapal S Yadav; Ramniwas Mahore; Anand Pratap Singh,"<jats:p>Introduction: Enormous amounts of hazardous and infectious waste are produced in hospitals across the world in the course of various biomedical procedures. India produces approximately 2kg/bed/day. India has well established protocols for handling and management of biomedical waste, namely, the BMW (Management and Handling) Amendment Rules, 2000. These rules mandate healthcare facilities to segregate disinfect and dispose biomedical wastes in a manner which protects the safety of healthcare professionals as well as that of the environment. Aims and Objectives: To find out the levels and areas of gaps in knowledge, attitudes and practices towards BMW management among various health care personnel. Material and Methods: A before and after interventional study was carried out on 150 participants from J.A.H. group of Hospitals, Gwalior. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was prepared and used for data collection. A Planned teaching and audiovisual presentation for the biomedical waste management was prepared and applied for assessment. Results: Out of 150 participants, before the educational intervention the level of knowledge about bio medical waste management among senior doctors and junior doctors were 70.0% and 65.0 respectively and significantly (p&lt;0.05) excellent in comparison to nursing and sanitary staff. Educational intervention had significantly improved BW management knowledge in all group studied. Conclusion: It can be concluded from the present study that there are fair levels of knowledge and awareness about BM waste generation hazards, legislation and management among health care personnel in J.A group of hospitals. Regular monitoring and training is required at all levels to fill up the lacunae in knowledge.</jats:p>",Biomedical waste; Dispose pattern; Health care; Legislation; Medicine; Mandate; Personal protective equipment; Hazardous waste; Nursing; Intervention (counseling); Medical waste; Engineering; Waste management; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Infectious disease (medical specialty); Disease; Pathology; Political science; Law; Economics; Economic growth,,,10.52711/2321-5763.2022.00031,false

Qualitative results alone do not provide detailed data to understand levels of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence within a populace. To enable this, a minimum data set is required to support standardised data reporting.&#x0D;; ApproachThe CO-CONNECT project is concerned with the response to COVID within the UK and how datasets can be made Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). One aspect of this is a focus upon improving granular levels of COVID serology testing data being reported by national laboratories to the National Pathology Exchange (NPEx). A study was conducted to ascertain the essential data elements that could formulate a COVID Serology Data Standard (CSDS). Three NHS laboratories acting as pilot studies and NPEx have been actively involved with the development of the CSDS, together with clinicians and academics from the CO-CONNECT project.&#x0D;; ResultsFeedback from clinicians, academics and NPEx has been collected, together with NHS laboratory feasibility analysis to derive a minimum set of data elements that form a proposed data standard to standardise the reporting of laboratory COVID serology data for the UK. The proposed CSDS comprises twelve data elements in total, grouped into four main areas, (1) subject identifier and test date and time, (2) analyser types, test kits and samples, (3) qualitative results and (4) quantitative results. To further support the standardisation effort, a proposed Health Level Seven (HL7) message structure has been created to enable the reporting of the CSDS data elements to NPEx.&#x0D;; ConclusionThe CSDS has been created to help augment levels of reported granular data for laboratory COVID serology testing. If adopted, this could enable healthcare professionals to better understand the calibration of assays across multiple analyser types and thus antibody response levels.</jats:p>",Computer science; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Interoperability; Analyser; Data set; Serology; Identifier; Data science; Snowball sampling; Test (biology); Pandemic; Set (abstract data type); Data mining; Medicine; Artificial intelligence; Pathology; World Wide Web; Disease; Immunology; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Paleontology; Chemistry; Chromatography; Antibody; Biology; Programming language,,,10.23889/ijpds.v7i3.1887,true

Such governance is critical not only for patient safety and accountability by a health system, but to foster clinician trust to improve adoption and facilitate meaningful health outcomes. In this case study, we describe the development of such a governance structure at University of Wisconsin Health (UWH) that provides oversight of AI applications from assessment of validity and user acceptability through safe deployment with continuous monitoring for effectiveness. Our structure leverages a multi-disciplinary steering committee along with project specific sub-committees. Members of the committee formulate a multi-stakeholder perspective spanning informatics, data science, clinical operations, ethics, and equity. Our structure includes guiding principles that provide tangible parameters for endorsement of both initial deployment and ongoing usage of AI applications. The committee is tasked with ensuring principles of interpretability, accuracy, and fairness across all applications. To operationalize these principles, we provide a value stream to apply the principles of AI governance at different stages of clinical implementation. This structure has enabled effective clinical adoption of AI applications. Effective governance has provided several outcomes: (1) a clear and institutional structure for oversight and endorsement; (2) a path towards successful deployment that encompasses technologic, clinical, and operational, considerations; (3) a process for ongoing monitoring to ensure the solution remains acceptable as clinical practice and disease prevalence evolve; (4) incorporation of guidelines for the ethical and equitable use of AI applications.",Software deployment; Operationalization; Corporate governance; Process management; Accountability; Stakeholder; Health care; Knowledge management; Computer science; Management science; Business; Medicine; Engineering; Political science; Public relations; Philosophy; Epistemology; Finance; Law; Operating system,AI; AI adoption; Clinical AI; equity; ethics; governance; oversight; predictive analytics,,10.3389/fdgth.2022.931439,true

The British Society of Gastroenterology warns that unavoidable delays to surveillance colonoscopy due to the pandemic risks delayed cancer diagnosis.<sup>1</sup> We undertook a quality improvement initiative to assess if virtual pre-assessment can be adopted as an alternative to face to face (F2F) clinic, thereby improving efficiency whilst reducing patient and staff risk. <h3>Methods</h3> The current situation was assessed, change identified, and quality improvement (QI) designed<sup>2</sup> utilising a Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) method to increase clinic capacity by 10% from 90% to 100% within 8 weeks. Key stakeholders working with the systems were engaged. A single practitioner trialled and evaluated accuRX video consultation remotely. Patients required a smart phone with video capabilities. Telephone consultations were conducted here patients were unable to connect. Patients received text message links to the video platform within 24hrs of appointment. 30-minute appointment slots were allocated to gather patient health history, obtain consent and educate on bowel preparation. 10 minutes was allocated for completion of electronic records and processing of bowel prep for postage. Nursing records were completed electronically and saved securely on hospital shared drive. <h3>Results</h3> The 10% target was achieved within 8 weeks. 13 virtual clinics provided 84 clinic appointment; 78 patients (age range 18 to 92) attended clinic (45 video &amp; 33 telephone) with 2 later converted to F2F appt. 6 DNA clinic appointment. Reasons for conversion to telephone clinic are outlined in table 1. 64 patients completed procedures, 4 awaiting test, 5 declined, 3 unwell and 2 not suitable. 94% of colonoscopy reported excellent, good, or fair bowel preparation. Patient experience was not formally measured. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our results indicate video pre-assessment to be an alternative to F2F long-term. Strategies to improve uptake need consideration prior to wide scale implementation. Formal data is required to measure patient experience and preference. Furthermore, as we move toward a greener approach to endoscopic working the reduction of carbon footprint by minimising F2F appointments should also be acknowledged. <h3>Reference</h3> BSG (2021) Colonoscopy for high-risk surveillance patients during COVID-19. https://www.bsg.org.uk/covid-19-advice/an-update-to-information-and-guidance-for-endoscopy-services-in-the-covid-19-pandemic-2/ Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) (2021) <i>A guide to quality improvement tools.</i> London: HQIP",Medicine; Telemedicine; Medical emergency; Phone; Colonoscopy; Quality management; Service (business); Health care; Family medicine; Colorectal cancer; Business; Linguistics; Philosophy; Cancer; Marketing; Internal medicine; Economics; Economic growth,,,10.1136/gutjnl-2022-bsg.231,false

Studies show increased rates of poor mental and physical illness among the minority ethnic ageing population compared with the majority population.<sup>1</sup> Research and GMC data also demonstrate disparities according to ethnicity in medical workforce outcomes across all measures of training and career progression, as well as GMC investigations and sanctions.<sup>2</sup> <h3>Race Equity in Palliative Care</h3> Within palliative care there is evidence of poor access and outcomes for minority ethnic groups. This has commonly been attributed to deficits within minority ethnic communities such as lack of awareness and misconceptions of services, religious and cultural preferences, a reluctance to engage in advance care planning and language barriers. Little serious consideration has been given to structural disadvantage.<sup>3</sup> <h3>Race Equity Committee</h3> Following the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter demonstrations of 2020, the APM supported the creation of a Race Equity Committee, led by a group of trainees and consultants working within the specialty from minority ethnic backgrounds. The Committee has been supported by members of the APM executive team. The Committee aims to: Create a safe space for members from minority ethnic backgrounds to share experiences and views on how to address racial and ethnic inequity. Understand the experiences of staff working within palliative care of racial and ethnicity-based prejudice and discrimination. Support the development of an anti-racism strategy within the APM. Progress: The committee have valued peer support and aim to expand membership so others can benefit from a safe space for minority ethnic staff within palliative care. Safe spaces for allies will also be supported. A staff survey to explore experiences of racism within palliative care is due for release.

This study is aimed at exploring a world-wide view on AI technologies in relation to knowledge, perceptions, and expectations of radiography professionals.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">An online survey (hosted on Qualtrics) on key AI concepts was open to radiography professionals worldwide (August 1st to December 31st 2020). The survey sought both quantitative and qualitative data on topical issues relating to knowledge, perceptions, and expectations in relation to AI implementation in radiography practice. Data obtained was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (v.26) and the six-phase thematic analysis approach.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 314 valid responses were obtained with a fair geographical distribution. Of the respondents, 54.1% (157/290) were from North America and were predominantly clinical practicing radiographers (60.5%, 190/314). Our findings broadly relate to different perceived benefits and misgivings/shortcomings of AI implementation in radiography practice. The benefits relate to enhanced workflows and optimised workstreams while the misgivings/shortcomings revolve around de-skilling and impact on patient-centred care due to over-reliance on advanced technology following AI implementation.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"">Artificial intelligence is a tool but to operate optimally it requires human input and validation. Radiographers working at the interface between technology and the patient are key stakeholders in AI implementation. Lack of training and of transparency of AI tools create a mixed response of radiographers when they discuss their perceived benefits and challenges. It is also possible that their responses are nuanced by different regional and geographical contexts when it comes to AI deployment. Irrespective of geography, there is still a lot to be done about formalised AI training for radiographers worldwide. This is a vital step to ensure safe and effective AI implementation, adoption, and faster integration into clinical practice by healthcare workers including radiographers.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Advancement of AI technologies and implementation should be accompanied by proportional training of end-users in radiography and beyond. There are many benefits of AI-enabled radiography workflows and improvement on efficiencies but equally there will be widespread disruption of traditional roles and patient-centred care, which can be managed by a well-educated and well-informed workforce.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022.

168-168-005-760-503,Data-Driven Approaches to Maximize the Impact of Pediatric Clinical Trials.,2022,journal article,Pediatrics,American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP),United States,Florence T Bourgeois,"In this issue of Pediatrics, Brewster et al1 present an analysis of pediatric clinical trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov from 2007 to 2020. Focusing on interventional trials enrolling only children (up to 17 years), the authors examined rates of trial discontinuation and results reporting, including factors associated with these outcomes. Their analysis spans an extended period and encompasses a broad selection of trial designs and interventions, providing information on trends over time across the pediatric clinical trial enterprise. Their findings serve to highlight several key areas requiring continued focus and provide a benchmark for ongoing monitoring and assessment.The authors found that approximately 11% of trials were discontinued, with a modest reduction in this rate over the study period. Over one-third failed due to poor participant accrual, which was the most common reason for discontinuation irrespective of the type of trial sponsor. Prior studies have reported a wide range of rates for pediatric trial discontinuation and the current estimate is lower than previously reported. This is most likely related to the diverse types of trials examined in the current analysis, with prior evaluations focusing on more narrow trial selections, such as randomized pediatric clinical trials or pediatric drug trials conducted in the post-marketing phase.2,3 It is difficult to fully gauge the inefficiencies and loss this discontinuation rate represents without a better understanding of the resources invested in these trials or the number of participants enrolled in studies that failed to yield scientific findings. Nonetheless, it provides a reference across a broad cohort of pediatric trials and confirms the ongoing challenge of recruiting pediatric participants to clinical trials.The study also revealed that the timely dissemination of pediatric trial results through deposit in trial registries and publication in peer-reviewed journals, remains suboptimal. At 3 years since trial completion, only 23% of trials had results available in ClinicalTrials.gov and 39% had been published. Particularly notable is that compared with trials receiving funding from either industry or government entities, those sponsored by academic institutions were least likely to have results disseminated after trial completion (45% compared with 61% for trials with industry funding and 59% for those with government funding). This is consistent with prior studies demonstrating poor performance and marked variation in results reporting by academic medical centers across the US.4 While timely dissemination of research results represents a core mission of academic institutions, effective enforcement mechanisms are lacking. Closer monitoring of publication and reporting activities for pediatric clinical trials is warranted to reduce loss of scientific information and breaches in commitments to participating patients and families.5As we consider the persistent gap in generating clinical evidence and developing interventions for pediatric populations, we must consider not only ways to strengthen pediatric clinical trial infrastructure, but also methods to augment clinical trial data with other evidence types. Very few pediatric trials are large randomized controlled trials and the majority employ single-center designs.6 Leveraging collaborative networks and other multi-institutional endeavors should be the default approach whenever feasible to appropriately prioritize research questions, increase statistical power, and ensure study completion. Funding agencies can support ongoing development of such pediatric research infrastructure and encourage the use of multi-institutional study designs in research programs and funding opportunities. To supplement clinical trials, we must also maximize evidence generation from registries and real-world data, such as electronic heath records, pharmacy claims, and mobile technologies. Real-world data can be used in retrospective studies, for example by providing data for historical controls in the assessment of interventions used in small patient populations.7 These data can also support prospective, pragmatic randomized trials, where studies are embedded in routine clinical practice and longitudinal outcomes data are collected from electronic health records. Such studies hold tremendous promise in reducing costs and barriers to recruiting pediatric patients, enabling inclusion of diverse patient populations, and generating efficient and generalizable clinical evidence across pediatric healthcare settings.8The dissemination of trial results points to an additional area of consideration for maximizing the impact of pediatric clinical trials: data sharing and reuse. In clinical research, data sharing allows external investigators to augment and build on prior work by performing secondary analyses, meta-analyses of individual patient data, and method development. Since 2018, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) has required that a statement on plans for data sharing be included in publications of clinical trials, though the policy stopped short of making data sharing mandatory.9 The implementation of the current policy has been inconsistent, and it is estimated that less than a third of ICMJE-affiliated journals have adopted a data sharing policy.10 Beyond a commitment to share data, actual reuse of data requires additional resources and technical infrastructure, which may contribute to the low rates of data reuse seen in practice. Guiding principles have been established to facilitate sharing and effective data reuse, calling for all data to be FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.11 Implementation of such a framework across pediatric clinical trials will require not only greater data transparency and incentivization in our research community, but also consistent use of standard pediatric terminologies and pediatric-specific data ontologies.To act on the findings reported by Brewster et al, we must build consensus across the pediatric clinical trial enterprise on key features and trial outcomes deemed essential to maximizing resources and advancing pediatric clinical care. These could include measures of trial discontinuation, results reporting, and data sharing and reuse. Using a standard set of metrics, a data-driven approach could be applied to monitoring activities and directing modification and strengthening of research infrastructures, governing policies, and investment strategies. Formalizing ongoing evaluation would provide the needed tools to efficiently advance pediatric clinical trial infrastructures and maximize benefits to child health.",Medicine; Intensive care medicine; Clinical trial; MEDLINE; Internal medicine; Political science; Law,,Child; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans,10.1542/peds.2021-055815,false

Hence, the transformation into a more complex form, at best, serves the very purpose of both natural and artificial development. Singapore’s exceptional journey of becoming a crucial international commercial and financial hub paved the way toward being the frontrunner in creating a Smart Nation by embracing digitalization as the main driving force. At the same time, both its environmental and national security is highly dependent on innovation and international cooperation. This paper aims to present how Singapore embarked, among the first, on the digital pathway to ensure sustainability and reinforce resilience, as well as where it stands in the process of shaping its future by safeguarding the achievements of the welfare state (fair distribution of wealth, opportunity through education, highly developed healthcare system, social equality and responsibility). The creation of its digital identity is fueled by a vibrant digital economy and regulated by an effective digital government, enhanced by a sophisticated digital infrastructure. A holistic examination of different aspects of the city-state’s digital transformation, validated with relevant qualitative and quantitative data, appears to be vital in determining the ideal trajectory of maintaining its benchmark status. This research also highlights the correlation between digitalization, the propagation of artificial intelligence in all spreads of life, and, as a consequence, the evolution of consumer trends due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the generation change amid the comprehensive set of regional and global challenges ahead.",Sustainability; Digital transformation; Government (linguistics); Safeguarding; Resilience (materials science); Sustainable development; Digital economy; Business; Psychological resilience; Public relations; Computer science; Economic growth; Engineering; Political science; Economics; Medicine; Psychology; Ecology; Linguistics; Philosophy; Physics; Nursing; World Wide Web; Law; Psychotherapist; Biology; Thermodynamics,,,10.1109/iccc202255925.2022.9922714,false

Methodologically speaking, use cases have required the creation of specific cohorts of patients, population subgroups or populations, and the identification of events of interest - over-time differences in health status and care healthcare utilisation before and during the pandemic. Technologically speaking, PHIRI infrastructure consists of a distributed end-to-end analytical pipeline containing the statistical analysis workflow, including data quality assessment at origin and the mathematical algorithms. Once datasets are prepared in each data hub, partners run the analyses and produce a research output (dashboards containing the research results and tables with aggregated data) that is shared for results compilation and comparative analysis. An enhanced version of the PHIRI infrastructure should allow more complex data distribution. The research questions covered so far are aiming inference on populations or providers, which implies a very simple distribution methodology, as described. However, when the research questions requires inference on the individuals (eg, quasi-experimental study on the effectiveness of a real-life intervention), when the inference requires a hierarchical approach (ie, part of the variance is at individual level and part at cluster level) or when, several rounds of training are needed (eg, validation of an artificial intelligence) the approach would require sharing coefficients, distances in n-dimensional spaces or models, and, some times various rounds of distribution. Finally, an enhanced version of the PHIRI infrastructure should generalise the current FAIR approach limited to the publication of the analytical pipeline in ZENODO, setting up the services and tools required for an improved version of the PHIRI open-science strategy.</jats:p>",Computer science; Workflow; Inference; Pipeline (software); Data science; Statistical inference; Data mining; Population; Identification (biology); Health care; Variance (accounting); Artificial intelligence; Statistics; Medicine; Mathematics; Botany; Business; Environmental health; Accounting; Database; Economics; Biology; Programming language; Economic growth,,,10.1093/eurpub/ckac129.468,true

Some developed AI models fail to offer a fair output for specific minority groups, sparking comprehensive discussions about AI fairness. We argue that the development of AI systems is marked by a central paradox: the less participation one stakeholder has within the AI system's life cycle, the more influence they have over the way the system will function. This means that the impact on the fairness of the system is in the hands of those who are less impacted by it. However, most of the existing works ignore how different aspects of AI fairness are dynamically and adaptively affected by different stages of AI system development. To this end, we present a use case to discuss fairness in the development of corporate wellness programs using smart wearables and AI algorithms to analyze data. The four key stakeholders throughout this type of AI system development process are presented. These stakeholders are called service designer, algorithm designer, system deployer, and end-user. We identify three core aspects of AI fairness, namely, contextual fairness, model fairness, and device fairness. We propose a relative contribution of the four stakeholders to the three aspects of fairness. Furthermore, we propose the boundaries and interactions between the four roles, from which we make our conclusion about the possible unfairness in such an AI developing process.",Computer science; Stakeholder; Process (computing); Wearable computer; Artificial intelligence; Key (lock); Service (business); Knowledge management; Process management; Computer security; Business; Management; Marketing; Economics; Embedded system; Operating system,Artificial intelligence; Classification model; Corporate wellness program; Fairness; Smartwatches,,10.1007/s00146-022-01562-4,true

During this process, the child can experience fear, anxiety, and pain simultaneously. As a randomized controlled VR study, this research was conducted to determine the effect of virtual reality (VR) glasses on reducing fear/anxiety and pain during circumcision in children.&#x0D;; Methods: The study was conducted on 125 children (6-11 years old). The same healthcare team performed the circumcision of the children in both groups. The children were randomly split into VR and control groups. The children in the VR group, just before the circumcision, watched their preferred cartoon film via VR glasses. No additional procedure was applied to the children in the control group except for ordinary procedures in the hospital. The fear and pain status measured by Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale and Children Fair Scale of all the children were evaluated before and after the operation by the child, parents, and the observer. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, and t-tests analyzed the data.&#x0D;; Results: There was no significant difference between the groups regarding demographic characteristics such as age, BMI, previous hospitalization, and anesthetic drug used before the procedure of the children included in the study. Preoperative (VR = 1.03 (0.18), control = 1.05 (0.22)) and pre-procedural (VR = 2.61 (1.02), control = 2.33 (1.22)) fear levels were also similar (P &gt; 0.05). After the procedure, it was determined that the mean duration of the procedure (365.36 (64.73) sec), crying time (21.31 (41.74) sec), and fear scores (0.36 (0.68)) of the children in the VR group were lower (P &lt; 0.001). However, pain mean scores were similar (P &gt; 0.05).&#x0D;; Conclusion: It is thought that watching a cartoon with VR glasses during the circumcision operation may be effective in reducing the child's fear level, crying, and operation time.</jats:p>",Anxiety; Randomized controlled trial; Virtual reality; Medicine; Descriptive statistics; Physical therapy; FLACC scale; Psychology; Clinical psychology; Psychiatry; Surgery; Statistics; Mathematics; Artificial intelligence; Computer science,,,10.28982/josam.993190,true

They remain a major public health problem associated with high mortality and morbidity globally with an estimated 499million new infections each year globally influencing the quality of life, sexual, reproductive health including maternal and child health and affecting mostly young people especially in low- and middle-income countries from which adolescent female are most vulnerable and affected. Methodology: A descriptive cross sectional study design was conducted where a multistage sampling was used in selecting a total of 317 study participants. A structured self-administered questionnaire was utilized in this study. Data collected was analyzed and results were presented using appropriate tables and charts. Chi square test was carried out to check association between some socio-demographic characteristics and knowledge, understanding and healthcare seeking behaviours at P&lt;0.05 level of significance.  Result: A total of 317 adolescent schoolgirls from 2private and 2 public secondary school participated in the study. Majority of the study participants had heard about STIs 267(90.2%) with teachers and the media as their major source of information for STIs. Overall, 33.1% of the participant had good knowledge, 48.3% are fairly knowledgeable while 18.6% had poor knowledge of STIs. Understanding of information about STIs was limited where majority of the participants do not perceive themselves to be at risk of contracting STIs. The proportion of healthcare seeking among participants was low and care seeking was majorly from informal sources 36 % (traditional healer) participants also, pointed out confidentiality as major barrier to seeking healthcare. Conclusion: Knowledge among the study participants was fair for general knowledge but lacked depth, thus pointing out the need for a culturally appropriate comprehensive sexuality educational curriculum, that will improve the overall knowledge of STIs since adolescence provide opportunity to mitigate risk. Another need highlighted by this study is that of a youth friendly affordable sexual and reproductive health service free of discrimination that is accessible to adolescents especially girls.</jats:p>",Reproductive health; Medicine; Confidentiality; Health care; Public health; Family medicine; Environmental health; Population; Demography; Nursing; Sociology; Political science; Law; Economics; Economic growth,,,10.30574/gscbps.2022.20.2.0234,true

To prepare FAIR data, a new data science discipline known as data stewardship is emerging and, as the FAIR Guidelines gain more acceptance, an increase in the demand for data stewards is expected. Consequently, there is a need to develop curricula to foster professional skills in data stewardship through effective knowledge communication. There have been a number of initiatives aimed at bridging the gap in FAIR data management training through both formal and informal programmes. This article describes the experience of developing a digital initiative for FAIR data management training under the Digital Innovations and Skills Hub (DISH) project. The FAIR Data Management course offers 6 short on-demand certificate modules over 12 weeks. The modules are divided into two sets: FAIR data and data science. The core subjects cover elementary topics in data science, regulatory frameworks, FAIR data management, intermediate to advanced topics in FAIR Data Point installation, and FAIR data in the management of healthcare and semantic data. Each week, participants are required to devote 7–8 hours of self-study to the modules, based on the resources provided. Once they have satisfied all requirements, students are certified as FAIR data scientists and qualified to serve as both FAIR data stewards and analysts. It is expected that in-depth and focused curricula development with diverse participants will build a core of FAIR data scientists for Data Competence Centres and encourage the rapid adoption of the FAIR Guidelines for research and development.</jats:p>",Stewardship (theology); Data management; Interoperability; Curriculum; Fair use; Knowledge management; Competence (human resources); Computer science; Business; World Wide Web; Political science; Sociology; Pedagogy; Management; Database; Politics; Law; Economics,,,10.1162/dint_a_00183,true

In the medical field, artificial intelligence is applied in laboratory research, regulation-policy making, and clinical intervention. Several factors need to be seriously accounted for in the AI-empowered healthcare system, including algorithm transparency, bias mitigation, domain-expert involvement, privacy and data protection, and informed consent. In this article, we summarized the applications of AI in the field of medical and healthcare sectors. We also presented the possible ethical issues in AI applications in mentioned sectors. These issues include transparency and safety, informed consent and right to information, algorithmic fairness and biases, and data privacy and sharing regulation. We then present the basic principles of AI ethics and the existing AI guidelines, especially for the fields of medicine and healthcare. Based on the existing issues and guidelines, we believe that there are still many factors that need to be perfected, such as how we can generalize these guidelines worldwide and how these guidelines can be legally-binding. Detailed clauses in the guideline and law enforcement are another issue that should be addressed such that no loophole can be addressed. Ethical consideration is critical in AI applications, especially in the medical and healthcare fields. Until these issues can be totally addressed, we believe that AI applications in healthcare should be very strictly monitored.</jats:p>",Transparency (behavior); Health care; Bioethics; Engineering ethics; Field (mathematics); Political science; Computer science; Public relations; Law; Engineering; Mathematics; Pure mathematics,,,10.56741/jphs.v1i02.215,true

In the battle against pandemics such as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), the vaccine is the only available course of prevention. The hesitancy has been found all over the world, while some find it against their religious values, others are concerned about safety, or have doubts about its efficacy. Some are hesitant due to fear of needles while some show brass negligence. Being the second most populated country globally and a developing nation, India had faced its fair share of struggles with her citizens vaccinated. Even a minute percentage of people accounts for millions; hence, it is of utmost importance to get to the root of the causes of delay in vaccination.  Aim: To find the causes of delay or hesitancy among the people attending COVID-19 vaccination centre of a tertiary care hospital of Kolkata, (a year after vaccines were introduced to the general population).  Materials And Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in the COVID-19 vaccination centre of Medical College Kolkata, West Bengal, India, from 14th January to 14th April 2022. Total 74 non medical (not related to healthcare work) people who had come for 1st or 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccination were included in the study. A prestructured, pretested, prevalidated questionnaire was used to collect data from the participants of the study. The Likert scale comprising of nine questions were used to assess hesitancy. Data were analysed using Chi-square test. Binary logistic regression was done to confirm any predictability of occupation, literacy rate, age and gender on vaccine hesitancy.  Results: The participants comprised of 45 (60.8%) females and 29 (39.2%) males, aged between 18 to 60 years with the mean age of 33.75±11.06 years. The participants included 22 (29.7%) people who had just taken their first dose. Twenty six (35.1%) participants were hesitant. The most common causes of hesitancy were individuals’ fear of the vaccine and its impact on general health, unavailability of slots for vaccination and reluctance. Out of total, 58 (78.4%) people had faith in vaccines made in India and 48 (64.9%) persons believed that the vaccine would provide complete protection against COVID-19.  Conclusion: People were mainly concerned about safety issues as adequate and reliable information was not available to them. Some of them ignored the importance of vaccination while some could not get vaccinated due to the unavailability of slots.</jats:p>",Vaccination; Cross-sectional study; Medicine; Family medicine; Pandemic; Health care; Population; Likert scale; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Environmental health; Disease; Psychology; Virology; Economic growth; Internal medicine; Developmental psychology; Pathology; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Economics,,,10.7860/jcdr/2022/57569.17142,true

Deliberative engagement approaches are often viewed as particularly useful in considering social values and balancing trade-offs, however, implementation of these approaches for priority setting is scant, especially in low and middle income settings. In order to address this gap we implemented a context specific public deliberation tool in a rural community in South Africa to determine priorities for a health services package. <h3>Methods</h3> Qualitative data were analysed from seven group deliberations using the engagement tool. Content analysis was conducted and inductive and deductive coding was used. The analysis focused on understanding the deliberative process, what the participants prioritised, the reasons for these selections and how negotiations took place within the groups. <h3>Results</h3> The deliberations demonstrated that the groups often prioritised curative services over primary prevention which related to perceived lack of efficacy of existing health education and prevention programmes in leading to behaviour change. The groups engaged deeply with trade-offs between costly treatment options for HIV/AIDS and those for non-communicable disease. Barriers to healthcare access were considered especially important by all groups and some priorities included investing in more mobile clinics. <h3>Discussion</h3> South Africa is committed to public engagement in priority-setting for health, yet the views of communities are not considered in policy and programme development which largely involves top down decision making. This study demonstrates that deliberative engagement methods can be successful in helping communities balance trade-offs and in eliciting social values around health priorities. The findings from such deliberations, alongside other evidence and broader ethical considerations, have the potential to inform decision-making with regard to health policy design and implementation.",Deliberation; Public relations; Negotiation; Public health; Public engagement; Context (archaeology); Community engagement; Health care; Health policy; Political science; Business; Medicine; Psychology; Economic growth; Nursing; Geography; Economics; Archaeology; Politics; Law,,,10.1136/bmjgh-2022-isph.6,true

The evolution of numerous medical imaging techniques has enhanced the accuracy of the preliminary analysis of several diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prevalent technology extensively used in evaluating the progress of the spread of malignant tissues or abnormalities in the human body. This article aims to automate a computationally efficient mechanism that can accurately identify the tumor from MRI images and can analyze the impact of the tumor. The proposed model is robust enough to classify the tumors with minimal training data. The generative variational autoencoder models are efficient in reconstructing the images identical to the original images, which are used in adequately training the model. The proposed self-learning algorithm can learn from the insights from the autogenerated images and the original images. Incorporating long short-term memory (LSTM) is faster processing of the high dimensional imaging data, making the radiologist's task and the practitioners more comfortable assessing the tumor's progress. Self-learning models need comparatively less data for the training, and the models are more resource efficient than the various state-of-art models. The efficiency of the proposed model has been assessed using various benchmark metrics, and the obtained results have exhibited an accuracy of 89.7%. The analysis of the progress of tumor growth is presented in the current study. The obtained accuracy is not pleasing in the healthcare domain, yet the model is reasonably fair in dealing with a smaller size dataset by making use of an image generation mechanism. The study would outline the role of an autoencoder in self-learning models. Future technologies may include sturdy feature engineering models and optimized activation functions that would yield a better result.",Autoencoder; Computer science; Benchmark (surveying); Artificial intelligence; Medical imaging; Deep learning; Identification (biology); Machine learning; Domain (mathematical analysis); Magnetic resonance imaging; Generative model; CAD; Pattern recognition (psychology); Generative grammar; Radiology; Medicine; Mathematical analysis; Botany; Mathematics; Geodesy; Engineering drawing; Engineering; Biology; Geography,,"Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Algorithms; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted",10.1155/2023/1566123,true

Giordano,"Previous research shows that generalized trust, the belief that most people can be trusted, is conducive to people's health. However, only recently have longitudinal studies suggested an additional reciprocal pathway from health back to trust. Drawing on a diverse body of literature that shows how egalitarian social policy contributes to the promotion of generalized trust, we hypothesize that this other ‘reverse’ pathway could be sensitive to health insurance context. Drawing on nationally representative US panel data from the General Social Survey, we examine whether the Affordable Care Act of 2010 could have had influence on the deteriorating impact of worsening self-rated health (SRH) on generalized trust. Firstly, using two-wave panel data (2008–2010, N = 1403) and employing random effects regression models, we show that a lack of health insurance coverage negatively determines generalized trust in the United States. However, this association is attenuated when additionally controlling for (perceived) income inequality. Secondly, utilizing data from two separate three-wave panel studies from the US General Social Survey (2006–10; N = 1652; 2010–2014; N = 1187), we employ fixed-effects linear regression analyses to control for unobserved heterogeneity from time-invariant factors. We demonstrate that worsening SRH was a stronger predictor for a decrease in generalized trust prior (2006–2010) to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Further, the negative effect of fair/poor SRH seen in the 2006–2010 data becomes attenuated in the 2010–2014 panel data. We thus find evidence for a substantial weakening of the previously established negative impact of decreasing SRH on generalized trust, coinciding with the most significant US healthcare reforms in decades.

To ensure the fairness of sensitive attributes, conventional studies mainly adopt calibration or re-weighting methods to balance the performance on among different demographic groups. However, we argue that these methods have some limitations. First, these methods usually mean a trade-off between the model's performance and fairness. Second, many methods completely attribute unfairness to the data collection process, which lacks substantial evidence. In this paper, we provide an empirical study to discover the possibility of using deconfounder to address the disparity issue in healthcare. Our study can be summarized in two parts. The first part is a pilot study demonstrating the exacerbation of disparity when unobserved confounders exist. The second part proposed a novel framework, Parity Medical Deconfounder (PriMeD), to deal with the disparity issue in healthcare datasets. Inspired by the deconfounder theory, PriMeD adopts a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to learn latent factors (substitute confounders) for observational data, and extensive experiments are provided to show its effectiveness.",Computer science; Weighting; Confounding; Health care; Observational study; Autoencoder; Econometrics; Health equity; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Data science; Data mining; Statistics; Medicine; Mathematics; Deep learning; Economics; Radiology; Economic growth,,,10.1145/3535508.3545516,true

A total of only 40 individual people with delirium who were treated with ECT were identified. In 33/40 cases, the aetiology of delirium was substance withdrawal. The number of ECT treatments administered ranged from 1 to 13. ECT was reported to positively contribute towards treatment of delirium in all cases, although objective measures of improvement were reported in only 6/13 patient cases from case reports and case series (46%). The singular quasi-experimental study reported a statistically significant decrease in duration of delirium, time spent in physical restraint, and in benzodiazepine requirement when ECT was used as an adjunct in benzodiazepine withdrawal delirium. When adverse events were described these included mild confusion and memory deficits; all were reported as time limited and reversible.

Many states and hospital systems do not have contingency standards of care to dictate allocation absent an event triggering crisis standards. Crisis standards of care, used when healthcare capacity becomes overwhelmed and cannot meet regular standards of patient care, reflect ethical priorities relevant in times of shortage or other emergencies. These priorities include saving the most lives, the stewardship of scarce resources, and justice relating to equitable resource distribution.[2] Crisis standards of care delineate specialized allocation protocols and triage decision-making bodies at the institutional or state levels. Crisis standards of care require formal activation at the state level, and in the absence of clear triggers or governmental willingness to use them, hospitals may adopt informal strategies to manage allocation in the form of contingency measures.; The contingency phase is defined by two simultaneous goals: prevent or stall crisis-level scarcity by managing limited resources and providing patient care that is functionally equivalent to usual care.[3] In other words, allocate scarce resources with no significant health consequences to patients. However, this is an unrealistic expectation: meeting a patient’s medical needs and allocating resources on the basis of scarcity instead of medical indications can be at odds, creating ethical tension. This paper addresses three ethical issues with the current contingency response stemming from this tension: the lack of formalization, the risk of using short-term solutions for prolonged contingency shortages, and the danger of exacerbating health disparities through hospital-level resource allocation. To mitigate these ethical issues, I offer recommendations for reimagining resource allocation during contingency standards of care.; l.     Lack of Formalization; One shortcoming of current contingency measures is that they fail to meet the same level of procedural detail and clarity as crisis standards. The early COVID-19 surges in Italy and France demonstrated the pitfalls of bedside allocation in the absence of procedural guidance. The acute scarcity of critical care resources forced doctors in these countries to make allocation decisions at the bedside, which often resulted in de facto age-based allocation as well as experiences of moral distress and shame among providers.[4] In France, medical allocation guidelines and statistics were never released to the public, raising concerns over the role of transparency in implementing crisis standards and triage guidelines and causing the public to question the trustworthiness of provider triage.[5] Though many states in the US have crisis standards of care that can be implemented in the case of a large-scale triage event, these measures vary widely. A 2020 review of 31 crisis standards of care in the US found that only 18 contained strong “ethical grounding,” 28 used “evidence-based clinical processes and operations,” 21 included “ongoing community and provider engagement, education, and communication,” and 16 had “clear indicators, triggers, and lines of responsibility.”[6]; The need for standardization, public transparency, and guidelines for crisis standards of care to prevent bedside allocation has been widely recognized. However, these issues remain unresolved by public policy or legislative efforts during the contingency period before (or after) crisis standards apply. A recent public health study that observed triage team members in a high-fidelity triage simulation highlighted the challenges of making equitable frontline allocation decisions.[7] In the simulation, participants nudged patient priority status up or down depending on what they subjectively identified as morally relevant factors. Through the simulation, participants reported difficulty separating implicit biases about patient characteristics from their clinical judgment. In the absence of formal institutional or regional guidelines for allocation during contingency-level shortages, there are few to no procedural safeguards against biased, ad hoc, and non-transparent rationing. Without formalized or standardized contingency allocation guidance, providers are left to make bedside allocation decisions that are susceptible to individual biases and patterns of unintended discrimination.; An example of this susceptibility is seen when hospitals allow patients who no longer benefit from ICU resources to continue occupying ICU beds. This is based on a first-come-first-served (FCFS) approach to bed allocation. FCFS is often a default for patient intake, which led to disparities in care access during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Media reports of hospitals with “plenty of space” being unwilling to accept patients from overwhelmed, lower-income hospitals illustrate that the FCFS default advantages those who could show up first to a particular hospital: often privileged, well-funded healthcare systems that were inaccessible to low-income communities.[8] FCFS is blind to several morally relevant factors, including the likelihood of survival to discharge, reciprocity (i.e. prioritizing healthcare workers), and varying degrees of access to healthcare. Therefore, it inappropriately privileges those in proximity to healthcare systems or with social connections enabling greater initial access to care.[9]; During crisis standards of care, excessive mortality that would result from FCFS is mitigated through formalized system-wide triage protocols based on current patient health status and potential benefit from resources. Crisis and contingency standards may provide liability coverage for providers who reallocate critical care beds away from those who no longer benefit during periods of scarcity. This liability coverage shifts bed allocation away from an FCFS model, but only if the policy is well-defined, clearly established, and known to providers. Without a formal system to guide the process or transition from the usual method of allocation to the contingency period, contingency decisions about who gets a scarce resource may continue to operate on an implicit FCFS basis, even when approaching crisis levels of scarcity. Additionally, these decisions will fall unsustainably on individual providers or transfer center workers, leading to moral distress on the frontlines when hospitals are already strained.; Lessons from the crisis and contingency responses during COVID-19 can improve future contingency responses. There are multiple ways of achieving equity during contingency allocation, ranging from hospital-level to state-level policy changes. State-wide policies and interventions to facilitate resource-sharing can relieve some of the scarcity burdens that hospitals may face during the contingency period. For example, moving ICU patients to lower levels of care once they have sufficiently recovered is a challenge for doctors, who often call other hospitals to find open beds. In these situations, providers who do not move patients who no longer benefit from ICU beds unknowingly reinforce the FCFS system in which those who arrive first keep the scarce beds, while those who arrive later or wait for one are disadvantaged by having limited access to them. State-wide patient transfer centers, often facilitated by state public health departments, present an alternative by balancing patient needs and bed distribution more equitably and efficiently than individual physicians do, as demonstrated following COVID-19 surges in hospitalization.[10] These centers aid not only in allocating open tertiary care beds, but also in identifying open beds at lower levels of care and assisting physicians with transferring out patients who can be safely downgraded and no longer benefit from tertiary care resources. However, the simplest solution is to encourage the creation of ethics guidance or protocols for contingency allocation at the hospital level. In hospitals, institutional ethics guidance can help providers navigate difficult decisions and conversations with patients. When providers face time-sensitive allocation decisions, like the allocation of open ICU beds, the guidance would be a useful tool for making transparent, principled, and ethically justified allocation decisions in real-time to mitigate the risk of ad hoc or implicit rationing.; ll.     Unsuited for Prolonged Resource Shortages; Secondly, neither contingency nor crisis standards are currently designed to respond to prolonged strains on the healthcare system. Since the start of the pandemic, a prolonged period of staffing shortages began and is projected to persist.[11] However, both crisis and contingency standards assume that the system will eventually return to conventional standards of care. For example, as a contingency or crisis standard, many hospitals deferred elective surgeries to preserve limited resources for emergency and life-saving procedures. Massachusetts, for instance, issued a public health emergency order that required hospitals to defer 50 percent of all non-essential and non-urgent (elective) surgeries. This order demonstrates the use of this contingency measure in response to prolonged staffing and bed shortages.[12] However, the deferral of elective procedures can result in adverse long-term community health consequences. Medical conditions typically addressed through elective surgery, such as joint replacement surgeries for osteoarthritis patients, may worsen if delayed. This can result in greater numbers of acute emergencies, the need for more complex surgical procedures later, increased reliance on pain medications, and longer recovery times.[13] Without a greater understanding of long-term complications in community health, existing contingency strategies, such as the deferral of elective surgeries, may be unsuitable for prolonged shortages.; This becomes a greater threat to patient safety when contingency measures inappropriately take the place of crisis standards, risking the long-term implementation of emergency measures designed for temporary use. Although some state emergency planning documents identify indicators and triggers for activating contingency and crisis operations,[14] this transition is not always clear in action. For example, New York did not implement crisis standards of care during the early COVID-19 pandemic despite being one of the hardest-hit cities in the US.[15] Other states, including California, Texas, and Florida, did not activate crisis standards of care, leaving hospitals to implement informal contingency measures that ultimately required allocation strategies very similar or identical to many crisis standards of care protocols.[16] Due to the hesitance to activate crisis standards, ad hoc contingency measures and bedside decision-making prevailed over formal triage protocols. If contingency measures are not set forth in objective documents and are inappropriately used in the place of crisis standards, these short-term measures may result in an unfair or non-transparent distribution of scarce resources. When shortages in space, staff, or supplies jeopardize the ability to provide necessary care for critically ill patients under a conventional standard of care, failures to activate crisis standards risk the inappropriate use of ad hoc contingency measures in their place.; With clear contingency standards of care, the duration of an ad hoc approach could be limited. Crisis standards are defined and activated at the regional or state-wide level, but outside of hospital-specific resource limitations, there are generally no standardized indications or triggers for transitioning into and out of contingency measures. Leaving contingency needs to individual hospitals may seem beneficial but defining the contingency period at the hospital level and the crisis period at the state or regional level blurs the line about when it is appropriate for decision makers to activate crisis standards, risking delayed activation or failure to activate them at all. Therefore, it is important that state policies implement automatic triggers for activation that clearly delineate between contingency and crisis responses.[17] Automatic triggers based on validated metrics like remaining available resources can inform the appropriate decision makers about when they must activate crisis standards. These triggers should be transparent to the public, validated, and updated over time with evolving data. These automatic triggers would prevent confusion, inconsistent guidelines, and inequitable contingency allocation at the hands of distressed providers when crisis standards are needed. Defining when to begin crisis standards could help limit the length of the contingency period. This would protect against the inappropriate application of contingency measures to crisis-level scarcity and prolonged shortages that they could not sustainably ameliorate.; lll.     Potential to Exacerbate Health Disparities; Inconsistencies in contingency allocation open the door to disparities in care and unequal distribution of scarcity burdens among different communities based on their location or health needs. This is a concern because it is unclear whether contingency measures can meet their goal of achieving functionally equivalent patient outcomes when resource allocation must be balanced with patient-centered care.[18] The care under contingency standards is meant to be functionally equivalent to regular care. The definition assumes (or may wrongly suggest) that any contingency strategy in place to avoid critical scarcity has no significant impact on patient outcomes. While functional equivalence is attainable, there is currently little research into which contingency measures achieve functionally equivalent outcomes and which patient groups may be disproportionately affected by harmful resource allocation strategies. Although the transition from contingency standards to crisis standards is defined by the inability to provide functionally equivalent care, the difference in practice may merely be a distinction between visible, immediate sacrifices to patient well-being during crises and less-obvious, long-term decrements in community health due to protracted contingency care alterations.; Two common contingency measures are cause for concern over disparate patient outcomes and the attainability of functional equivalence. First, restricting emergency room visits by the patient’s degree of need has worrying consequences. In late 2021 and early 2022, hospitals in Massachusetts faced widespread staffing shortages, leading to an emergency order that restricted emergency visits to emergency needs.[19] While this order is a reasonable method of allocating limited staff in the emergency department during severe shortages, it is doubtful that the outcomes of this restriction were equivalent to usual care. Health issues that are soon-to-be emergencies are filtered out until they worsen, resulting in patients overflowing to urgent care clinics or presenting to ERs with more severe forms of sicknesses later on. Given the empirical evidence demonstrating ER treatment and admission disparities that disadvantage Black and Hispanic patients, such a measure would only exacerbate these disparities by further limiting access to needed care.[20]; Second, altered staffing ratios, which stretch a limited number of providers to meet patient needs during a staffing shortage, are another concerning yet common contingency measure. Staffing allocation is often viewed similarly to the allocation of space and medical equipment, such that contingency alterations to staffing operations may not seem like they significantly jeopardize patient care quality and outwardly appear functionally equivalent.[21] However, lower ratios of qualified nurses are associated with poor outcomes such as higher inpatient mortality[22] and lower survival rates of in-hospital cardiac arrest for Black patients.[23] These examples highlight the strong potential for contingency measures to amplify social health disparities, particularly when adopted over a prolonged time frame.; Lowered standards of care in crisis allocation disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities.[24] For example, crisis standards of care used clinical scoring systems that were not developed or validated for crisis triage to prioritize access to life-saving treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic. This practice actively gives rise to racial health disparities and discrimination against disabled patients.[25] Not only were the standards inequitable in practice, but they varied widely from state to state and sometimes even from hospital to hospital, creating disparities across and within geographic regions.[26] If contingency measures are similarly implemented across hospitals or hospital departments without standardization or advance planning to ensure equitable outcomes, it is likely that the burden of a lower standard of care will fall primarily on disadvantaged patient groups and racial minorities. However, standardization alone may be insufficient. Other factors like varying levels of details on patients’ charts between hospitals could produce unfair outcomes if used to determine patient admission or transfer priority, even if the criteria for admissions and transfers are consistent. Thus, ongoing monitoring for unintended patterns of disparity must accompany standardization to ensure that blind spots in the allocation process are identified and corrected.; Bioethics has long been preoccupied with the micro-allocation of limited resources within hospitals instead of confronting the structural inequities that underlie broader scarcity and patient needs. The traditional dilemma of allocating limited hospital resources among a certain number of patients overlooks questions about how other resources have already been allocated, which patients were present at the hospital in the first place, where hospitals have (and have not) been built, and whether previous allocation strategies created bias in the broader distribution of resources. Therefore, to achieve fairness, bioethicists must pay attention to aspects of the broader distribution of resources, such as social determinants of health and the allocation of preventative resources at the public health level. One strategy for measuring and addressing these disparities is the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). The ADI quantifies the effects of race, class, and socioeconomic background by geographic region for use in public health research and the prioritization of resources.[27] It has shown promise in identifying geographic regions in need of targeted community health efforts for diabetes management based on electronic patient health records.[28] The ADI and similar tools would be useful in proactively deciding how to allocate public health resources when hospitals are strained. Moreover, through using population health and resource data, public health organizations may forecast contingency shortages allowing for the adoption of early measures to mitigate health disparities that might otherwise be amplified from hospital-level contingency allocation decisions.; CONCLUSION; Meeting community health needs during periods of contingency scarcity, both before and after crisis standards of care apply, will require contingency standards of care rather than a bedside ad hoc distribution of scarce resources. While it is not inherently ethically unjustifiable for hospitals to adopt measures that may lower the standard of care during contingency standards, the necessity of these measures requires that bioethicists consider how equity, transparency, and the overall aim of functional equivalence can best be achieved under conditions of scarcity. The long-term health consequences of existing contingency measures, the potential for ad hoc and inconsistent allocation of scarce resources, and the need for consensus about when it becomes appropriate to make the formal transition to crisis standards of care demand further consideration. Because contingency measures will likely amplify existing disparities as crisis standards have, hospital-level management of scarcity is inadequate. Public health measures should be adopted in parallel to anticipate and manage health needs at the community or state level when resources are strained.; -; [1] Altevogt, B. M., Stroud, C., Hanson, S.

However, only some AI algorithms are utilised due to systems' uncertainties, besides the never-ending list of ethical and legal concerns. This paper intends to provide an overview of current AI challenges in medical imaging with an ultimate aim to foster better and effective communication among various stakeholders to encourage AI technology development. We identify four main challenges in implementing AI in medical imaging, supported with consequences and past events when these problems fail to mitigate. Among them is the creation of a robust AI algorithm that is fair, trustable and transparent. Another issue is on data governance, in which best practices in data sharing must be established to promote trust and protect the patients' privacy. Next, stakeholders, such as the government, technology companies and hospital management, should come to a consensus in creating trustworthy AI policies and regulatory frameworks, which is the fourth challenge, to support, encourage and spur innovation in digital AI healthcare technology. Lastly, we discussed the efforts of various organizations such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), American College of Radiology (ACR), European Society of Radiology (ESR) and Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), who are already actively pursuing ethical developments in AI. The efforts by various stakeholders will eventually overcome hurdles and the deployment of AI-driven healthcare applications in clinical practice will become a reality and hence lead to better healthcare services and outcomes.",Government (linguistics); Health care; Software deployment; Corporate governance; Applications of artificial intelligence; Business; Data sharing; Knowledge management; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Political science; Medicine; Philosophy; Linguistics; Alternative medicine; Finance; Pathology; Law; Operating system,Algorithm robustness; Artificial intelligence; Challenges; Data governance; Ethics; Medical imaging,Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Diagnostic Imaging; Humans; Radiography; Radiology,10.1016/j.ejmp.2022.06.003,true
197-913-737-344-010,"Supporting Health Equity through a Focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Medical Regulation: The FSMB's Initial Steps on a Critical Journey",2022,journal article,Journal of Medical Regulation,Federation of State Medical Boards,,Jeffrey D. Carter,"Structural inequities built into the American healthcare system and American society have received renewed attention of late due to disparities in COVID-19 treatment and outcomes. Unjust and racially motivated deaths of minoritized and marginalized individuals—often at the hands of those who are meant to offer protection—and significant disparities in key health indicators have become evident. This attention on structural inequities has caused many individuals and organizations to look inward and examine their own histories, policies, and procedures to identify past wrongs and current areas that are open to bias and discrimination. The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) is among such organizations. In 2019, the FSMB embarked on a journey to closely examine its past and to educate itself about how best to move forward in a way that balances the needs and priorities of all those it serves.Under the leadership of FSMB Past Chair Cheryl Walker-McGill, MD, MBA, the FSMB Board of Directors was provided with education and training about systemic racism, other forms of discrimination, and strategies for identifying and mitigating bias. Dr. Walker-McGill also created a Task Force on Health Equity and Medical Regulation that was charged with exploring what state medical boards can do to address health inequities and implicit bias, while also evaluating current policies and processes in medical licensing, discipline, and regulation. This Task Force provided guidance to the FSMB Board of Directors as it developed a Statement on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in Medical Regulation and Health Care, as well as a DEI “Blueprint.” This Blueprint is comprised of seven categories that provide broad guidance for ongoing and future work of the FSMB in anti-discrimination and DEI: Looking Inward; Fair and Transparent Processes; Advocating for Cultural Safety; Research and Data Optimization; Education and Support; Trust; and Collaboration. These have all been foundational themes in the FSMB’s work since the development of the Blueprint.Much of the subsequent work of the FSMB has been carried forward by the Workgroup on DEI in Medical Regulation and Patient Care, created by FSMB Immediate Past Chair Kenneth Simons, MD, in May of 2021. Dr. Simons charged the Workgroup, for which I have the honor of serving as Chair, with collecting and analyzing data about membership on state medical boards, considering educational opportunities for increasing the understanding of DEI among medical regulators and physicians, identifying best regulatory practices for ensuring fairness and incorporating the principles of equity and inclusion in board decision making, and promoting a better understanding of the impacts of bias, inequity and systemic racism on medical regulation, health and health care.The Workgroup began addressing its charge by examining the history of DEI in medical regulation and collecting information about the work that was already underway at the state level to address bias, combat discrimination, and increase DEI. Work-group members considered many helpful examples of training programs in implicit bias for board members and staff, strategic plans and initiatives of state medical boards, statements from board leadership in newsletters and on board websites, examples of data analysis and reporting that provided helpful and transparent insights into board processes, and practice guidance for licensees. It was extremely illuminating to learn about the wide variety of ways in which state medical boards from across the country are making meaningful progress on numerous aspects of anti-discrimination and DEI. Perhaps most illuminating are examples of special committees and staff positions that have been created at state medical boards to closely analyze policies and procedures vulnerable to bias. One such example comes from the Washington Medical Commission’s Health Equity Advisory Committee which conducted a review of rules, policies, procedures, and guidelines to identify several priority areas for change1. Notable changes include a blinded hiring process where applicants cannot be seen by Commission staff, redaction of demographic data from complainant statements, changes to licensing application processes to remove potentially biasing categories or information, and a newly drafted Policy Statement on Discrimination in Health Care.The Workgroup was also impressed to see legislation enacted in several states that mandate a minimum level of board diversity in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, and other demographics. This demonstrates recognition by state legislatures that diversity brings great value to state medical boards in fulfillment of their mission to protect the public, an idea our Workgroup members agree with wholeheartedly. This type of legislative strategy for increasing diversity on boards features prominently in an Interim Report of the Workgroup that was presented to the FSMB House of Delegates at its Annual Business Meeting in April of this year. The Interim Report provides an overview of the above-mentioned initiatives by state medical boards and the FSMB, while addressing numerous other concepts related to DEI that pertain to the work of state medical boards.The FSMB House of Delegates voted to adopt all seven of the recommendations in the Interim Report which address board composition, data gathering and analytic capacity among boards, education for board members, staff, licensees, and patients, and call for formal adoption of the statement of the FSMB Board of Directors on DEI in Medical Regulation and Health Care2.While we are very pleased with the progress made by our Workgroup thus far, we recognize that there remains a great deal of work to be done. Over the course of the coming year, we will attempt to build on the content of our interim report and engage with partners in medical practice and patient care, particularly those representing minoritized and otherwise marginalized physicians, to address elements of DEI that have a nexus to medical regulation. This will include a deeper look into social determinants of health and how knowledge of these factors can be incorporated into patient care to help address barriers to health and improve social justice.We will also look to turn policy into practice by leveraging a key element of the Workgroup’s interim report: the “DEI Playbook” which categorizes the state medical board practices that are vulnerable to bias and discrimination and provides strategies for mitigating and eliminating the potential biases associated with each one2. The Playbook, summarized in Table 1, is the Workgroup’s attempt to provide practical steps and solutions for state medical boards, regardless of their level of resources or operational autonomy. We hope that the Workgroup’s final report will offer meaningful ways to impact DEI for all state medical boards, wherever they are on their journeys to eliminate bias and discrimination in their own processes and improve health equity for the public they serve.",Equity (law); Health equity; Inclusion (mineral); Diversity (politics); Sociology; Public relations; Political science; Business; Social science; Health care; Law,,,10.30770/2572-1852-108.2.29,true
