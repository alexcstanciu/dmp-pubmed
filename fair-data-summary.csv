One of their drawbacks is that they often need very large amounts of data. Pre-existing datasets in the form of national cancer registries, image/genetic depositories and clinical datasets already exist and have been used for research. In theory, the combination of healthcare Big Data with modern, data-hungry artificial intelligence techniques should offer significant opportunities for artificial intelligence development, but this has not yet happened. Here we discuss some of the structural reasons for this, barriers preventing artificial intelligence from making full use of existing datasets, and make suggestions as to enable progress. To do this, we use the framework of the 6Vs of Big Data and the FAIR criteria for data sharing and availability (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse). We share our experience in navigating these barriers through The Brain Tumour Data Accelerator, a Brain Tumour Charity-supported initiative to integrate fragmented patient data into an enriched dataset. We conclude with some comments as to the limits of such approaches.","The FAIR principles are an important framework for enabling progress in the development of artificial intelligence using existing datasets.

The Brain Tumour Data Accelerator is an example of an initiative that uses the FAIR principles to integrate fragmented patient data into an enriched dataset."
7,10.1016/j.drudis.2022.01.006,Maximizing data value for biopharma through FAIR and quality implementation: FAIR plus Q.,"Over recent years, there has been exciting growth in collaboration between academia and industry in the life sciences to make data more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) to achieve greater value. Despite considerable progress, the transformative shift from an application-centric to a data-centric perspective, enabled by FAIR implementation, remains very much a work in progress on the 'FAIR journey'. In this review, we consider use cases for FAIR implementation. These can be deployed alongside assessment of data quality to maximize the value of data generated from research, clinical trials, and real-world healthcare data, which are essential for the discovery and development of new medical treatments by biopharma.","The FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) have been increasingly adopted in recent years to facilitate collaboration between academia and industry in the life sciences.

9,10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103421,FAIR data sharing: The roles of common data elements and harmonization.,"The value of robust and responsible data sharing in clinical research and healthcare is recognized by patients, patient advocacy groups, researchers, journal editors, and the healthcare industry globally. Privacy and security concerns acknowledged, the act of exchanging data (interoperability) along with its meaning (semantic interoperability) across studies and between partners has been difficult, if not elusive. For shared data to retain its value, a recommendation has been made to follow the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) principles. Without applying appropriate data exchange standards with domain-relevant content standards and accessible rich metadata that uses applicable terminologies, interoperability is burdened by the need for transformation and/or mapping. These obstacles to interoperability limit the findability, accessibility and reusability of data, thus diminishing its value and making it impossible to adhere to FAIR principles. One effort to standardize data collection has been through common data elements (CDEs). CDEs are data collection units comprising one or more questions together with a set of valid values. Some CDEs contain standardized terminology concepts that define the meaning of the data, and others include links to unique terminology concept identifiers and unique identifiers for each CDE; however, usually CDEs are defined for specific projects or collaborations and lack traceable or machine readable semantics. While the name implies that these are 'common', this has not necessarily been a requirement, and many CDEs have not been commonly used. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) CDEs are, in fact, a conglomerate of CDEs developed in silos by various NIH institutes. Therefore, CDEs have not brought the anticipated benefit to the industry through widescale interoperability, nor is there widespread reuse of CDEs. Certain institutes in the NIH recommend, albeit do not enforce, institute-specific preferred CDEs; however, at the NIH level a preponderance of choice and a lack of any overarching harmonization of CDEs or consistency in linking them to controlled terminology or common identifiers create confusion for researchers in their efforts to identify the best CDEs for their protocol. The problem of comparing data among studies is exacerbated when researchers select different CDEs for the same variable or data collection field. This manuscript explores reasons for the disappointingly low adoption of CDEs and the inability of CDEs or other clinical research standards to broadly solve the interoperability and data sharing problems. Recommendations are offered for rectifying this situation to enable responsible data sharing that will help in adherence to FAIR principles and the realization of Learning Health Systems for the sake of all of us as patients.","The FAIR principles are a set of guidelines for data sharing in clinical research and healthcare. They emphasize the importance of data exchange standards, content standards, and accessible rich metadata that uses applicable terminologies to ensure data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Common data elements (CDEs) have been used to standardize data collection, but have not been widely adopted due to a lack of harmonization and consistency in linking them to controlled terminology or common identifiers. This has hindered the ability to adhere to FAIR principles and realize Learning Health Systems. Recommendations are offered to rectify this situation and enable responsible data sharing."
10,10.3233/shti210801,A Learning Framework for Medical Image-Based Intelligent Diagnosis from Imbalanced Datasets.,"Medical image classification and diagnosis based on machine learning has made significant achievements and gradually penetrated the healthcare industry. However, medical data characteristics such as relatively small datasets for rare diseases or imbalance in class distribution for rare conditions significantly restrains their adoption and reuse. Imbalanced datasets lead to difficulties in learning and obtaining accurate predictive models. This paper follows the FAIR paradigm and proposes a technique for the alignment of class distribution, which enables improving image classification performance in imbalanced data and ensuring data reuse. The experiments on the acne disease dataset support that the proposed framework outperforms the baselines and enable to achieve up to 5% improvement in image classification.","The FAIR principles are used to improve the performance of medical image classification and diagnosis based on machine learning.

15,10.3390/ijerph15081644,Recommendations for Improving the Quality of Rare Disease Registries.,"Rare diseases (RD) patient registries are powerful instruments that help develop clinical research, facilitate the planning of appropriate clinical trials, improve patient care, and support healthcare management. They constitute a key information system that supports the activities of European Reference Networks (ERNs) on rare diseases. A rapid proliferation of RD registries has occurred during the last years and there is a need to develop guidance for the minimum requirements, recommendations and standards necessary to maintain a high-quality registry. In response to these heterogeneities, in the framework of RD-Connect, a European platform connecting databases, registries, biobanks and clinical bioinformatics for rare disease research, we report on a list of recommendations, developed by a group of experts, including members of patient organizations, to be used as a framework for improving the quality of RD registries. This list includes aspects of governance, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data and information, infrastructure, documentation, training, and quality audit. The list is intended to be used by established as well as new RD registries. Further work includes the development of a toolkit to enable continuous assessment and improvement of their organizational and data quality.","The FAIR principles are an important part of the development of rare disease (RD) patient registries.

17,10.1515/cclm-2022-1096,From big data to better patient outcomes.,"Among medical specialties, laboratory medicine is the largest producer of structured data and must play a crucial role for the efficient and safe implementation of big data and artificial intelligence in healthcare. The area of personalized therapies and precision medicine has now arrived, with huge data sets not only used for experimental and research approaches, but also in the ""<i>real world</i>"". Analysis of real world data requires development of legal, procedural and technical infrastructure. The integration of all clinical data sets for any given patient is important and necessary in order to develop a patient-centered treatment approach. Data-driven research comes with its own challenges and solutions. The Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) Guiding Principles provide guidelines to make data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable to the research community. Federated learning, standards and ontologies are useful to improve robustness of artificial intelligence algorithms working on big data and to increase trust in these algorithms. When dealing with big data, the univariate statistical approach changes to multivariate statistical methods significantly shifting the potential of big data. Combining multiple omics gives previously unsuspected information and provides understanding of scientific questions, an approach which is also called the systems biology approach. Big data and artificial intelligence also offer opportunities for laboratories and the <i>In Vitro</i> Diagnostic industry to optimize the productivity of the laboratory, the quality of laboratory results and ultimately patient outcomes, through tools such as predictive maintenance and ""moving average"" based on the aggregate of patient results.","The FAIR Guiding Principles provide guidelines to make data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable to the research community in order to facilitate the efficient and safe implementation of big data and artificial intelligence in healthcare.

19,10.1055/s-0040-1712510,Applying FAIR Principles to Improve Data Searchability of Emergency Department Datasets: A Case Study for HCUP-SEDD,"Background There is a recognized need to improve how scholarly data are managed and accessed. The scientific community has proposed the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principles to address this issue. Objective The objective of this case study was to develop a system for improving the FAIRness of Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's State Emergency Department Databases (HCUP's SEDD) within the context of data catalog availability. Methods A search tool, EDCat (Emergency Department Catalog), was designed to improve the “FAIRness” of electronic health databases and tested on datasets from HCUP-SEDD. ElasticSearch was used as a database for EDCat's search engine. Datasets were curated and defined. Searchable data dictionary-related elements and unified medical language system (UMLS) concepts were included in the curated metadata. Functionality to standardize search terms using UMLS concepts was added to the user interface. Results The EDCat system improved the overall FAIRness of HCUP-SEDD by improving the findability of individual datasets and increasing the efficacy of searches for specific data elements and data types. Discussion The databases considered for this case study were limited in number as few data distributors make the data dictionaries of datasets available. The publication of data dictionaries should be encouraged through the FAIR principles, and further efforts should be made to improve the specificity and measurability of the FAIR principles. Conclusion In this case study, the distribution of datasets from HCUP-SEDD was made more FAIR through the development of a search tool, EDCat. EDCat will be evaluated and developed further to include datasets from other sources.","The FAIR principles are a set of guidelines proposed by the scientific community to improve how scholarly data is managed and accessed.

20,10.1002/lrh2.10070,Preparing healthcare delivery organizations for managing computable knowledge.,"Introduction The growth of data science has led to an explosion in new knowledge alongside various approaches to representing and sharing biomedical knowledge in computable form. These changes have not been matched by an understanding of what healthcare delivery organizations need to do to adapt and continuously deploy computable knowledge. It is therefore important to begin to conceptualize such changes in order to facilitate routine and systematic application of knowledge that improves the health of individuals and populations. Methods An AHRQ-funded conference convened a group of experts from a range of fields to analyze the current state of knowledge management in healthcare delivery organizations and describe how it needs to evolve to enable computable knowledge management. Presentations and discussions were recorded and analyzed by the author team to identify foundational concepts and new domains of healthcare delivery organization knowledge management capabilities. Results Three foundational concepts include 1) the current state of knowledge management in healthcare delivery organizations relies on an outdated biomedical library model, and only a small number of organizations have developed enterprise-scale knowledge management approaches that ""push"" knowledge in computable form to frontline decisions, 2) the concept of Learning Health Systems creates an imperative for scalable computable knowledge management approaches, and 3) the ability to represent data science discoveries in computable form that is FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) is fundamental to spread knowledge at scale. For healthcare delivery organizations to engage with computable knowledge management at scale, they will need new organizational capabilities across three domains: policies and processes, technology, and people. Examples of specific capabilities were developed. Conclusions Healthcare delivery organizations need to substantially scale up and retool their knowledge management approaches in order to benefit from computable biomedical knowledge.","The FAIR principles are essential for healthcare delivery organizations to be able to effectively use computable knowledge management at scale.

21,10.3233/shti210817,Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) in a FAIR Metadata Registry for COVID-19 Research.,"Adopting international standards within health research communities can elevate data FAIRness and widen analysis possibilities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mapping feasibility against HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources® (FHIR)® of a generic metadata schema (MDS) created for a central search hub gathering COVID-19 health research (studies, questionnaires, documents = MDS resource types). Mapping results were rated by calculating the percentage of FHIR coverage. Among 86 items to map, total mapping coverage was 94%: 50 (58%) of the items were available as standard resources in FHIR and 31 (36%) could be mapped using extensions. Five items (6%) could not be mapped to FHIR. Analyzing each MDS resource type, there was a total mapping coverage of 93% for studies and 95% for questionnaires and documents, with 61% of the MDS items available as standard resources in FHIR for studies, 57% for questionnaires and 52% for documents. Extensions in studies, questionnaires and documents were used in 32%, 38% and 43% of items, respectively. This work shows that FHIR can be used as a standardized format in registries for clinical, epidemiological and public health research. However, further adjustments to the initial MDS are recommended - and two additional items even needed when implementing FHIR. Developing a MDS based on the FHIR standard could be a future approach to reduce data ambiguity and foster interoperability.","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mapping feasibility of a generic metadata schema (MDS) created for a central search hub gathering COVID-19 health research to the HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources® (FHIR)®.

This interdisciplinary project, spanning 22 organisations, is connecting data from &gt;50 large research cohorts and data collected through routine healthcare provision across the UK.; ApproachAcross the UK, data has been collected that can help us answer key questions about COVID-19. As the data are in many places with many different processes it is difficult and complex for public health groups, researchers, policymakers, and government to find and access lots of high-quality data quickly and efficiently to make decisions. In collaboration with Health Data Research UK, CO-CONNECT is streamlining processes of accessing data for research.; Results1) Discovering data and meta-analysis: CO-CONNECT enables researchers to determine how many people meet their research criteria within the various datasets across the UK through the Health Data Research Innovation Gateway Cohort Discovery tool e.g. “How many people in each dataset have had a PCR test which was positive and were under the age of 40?” Only summary level, anonymous data are provided so researchers can answer such questions rapidly without requiring multiple data governance permissions and directly contacting each data source. The tool also supports aggregate level meta-analysis of the data.; 2) Detailed analysis: With data governance approvals, researchers can analyse detailed level, standardised, linked, pseudonymised data in a Trusted Research Environment. The common format reduces the effort on each research project, supporting rapid research.; ConclusionProviding data in this de-identifiable, safe way enables rapid, robust research e.g., COVID-19 results from a test centre can be linked to hospital records along with prescriptions from pharmacies enabling researchers to understand whether people with different existing health conditions are more or less susceptible to COVID-19.

The Dutch National Intensive Care Evaluation (NICE) quality registry adopted the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Database Model (OMOP CDM) to achieve a FAIR database. In the process of adopting the OMOP CDM, many modeling, technical, and communication challenges needed to be solved. Through communication with the OMOP CDM implementation community, previously done research and trial-and-error we found solutions that we believe can help other healthcare institutions, especially ICU quality registries, FAIRify their databases.","The FAIR principles of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable are essential for health data to be used in integrative analysis with other datasets, especially during the current pandemic.

28,10.1542/peds.2021-055815,Data-Driven Approaches to Maximize the Impact of Pediatric Clinical Trials.,"In this issue of Pediatrics, Brewster et al1 present an analysis of pediatric clinical trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov from 2007 to 2020. Focusing on interventional trials enrolling only children (up to 17 years), the authors examined rates of trial discontinuation and results reporting, including factors associated with these outcomes. Their analysis spans an extended period and encompasses a broad selection of trial designs and interventions, providing information on trends over time across the pediatric clinical trial enterprise. Their findings serve to highlight several key areas requiring continued focus and provide a benchmark for ongoing monitoring and assessment.The authors found that approximately 11% of trials were discontinued, with a modest reduction in this rate over the study period. Over one-third failed due to poor participant accrual, which was the most common reason for discontinuation irrespective of the type of trial sponsor. Prior studies have reported a wide range of rates for pediatric trial discontinuation and the current estimate is lower than previously reported. This is most likely related to the diverse types of trials examined in the current analysis, with prior evaluations focusing on more narrow trial selections, such as randomized pediatric clinical trials or pediatric drug trials conducted in the post-marketing phase.2,3 It is difficult to fully gauge the inefficiencies and loss this discontinuation rate represents without a better understanding of the resources invested in these trials or the number of participants enrolled in studies that failed to yield scientific findings. Nonetheless, it provides a reference across a broad cohort of pediatric trials and confirms the ongoing challenge of recruiting pediatric participants to clinical trials.The study also revealed that the timely dissemination of pediatric trial results through deposit in trial registries and publication in peer-reviewed journals, remains suboptimal. At 3 years since trial completion, only 23% of trials had results available in ClinicalTrials.gov and 39% had been published. Particularly notable is that compared with trials receiving funding from either industry or government entities, those sponsored by academic institutions were least likely to have results disseminated after trial completion (45% compared with 61% for trials with industry funding and 59% for those with government funding). This is consistent with prior studies demonstrating poor performance and marked variation in results reporting by academic medical centers across the US.4 While timely dissemination of research results represents a core mission of academic institutions, effective enforcement mechanisms are lacking. Closer monitoring of publication and reporting activities for pediatric clinical trials is warranted to reduce loss of scientific information and breaches in commitments to participating patients and families.5As we consider the persistent gap in generating clinical evidence and developing interventions for pediatric populations, we must consider not only ways to strengthen pediatric clinical trial infrastructure, but also methods to augment clinical trial data with other evidence types. Very few pediatric trials are large randomized controlled trials and the majority employ single-center designs.6 Leveraging collaborative networks and other multi-institutional endeavors should be the default approach whenever feasible to appropriately prioritize research questions, increase statistical power, and ensure study completion. Funding agencies can support ongoing development of such pediatric research infrastructure and encourage the use of multi-institutional study designs in research programs and funding opportunities. To supplement clinical trials, we must also maximize evidence generation from registries and real-world data, such as electronic heath records, pharmacy claims, and mobile technologies. Real-world data can be used in retrospective studies, for example by providing data for historical controls in the assessment of interventions used in small patient populations.7 These data can also support prospective, pragmatic randomized trials, where studies are embedded in routine clinical practice and longitudinal outcomes data are collected from electronic health records. Such studies hold tremendous promise in reducing costs and barriers to recruiting pediatric patients, enabling inclusion of diverse patient populations, and generating efficient and generalizable clinical evidence across pediatric healthcare settings.8The dissemination of trial results points to an additional area of consideration for maximizing the impact of pediatric clinical trials: data sharing and reuse. In clinical research, data sharing allows external investigators to augment and build on prior work by performing secondary analyses, meta-analyses of individual patient data, and method development. Since 2018, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) has required that a statement on plans for data sharing be included in publications of clinical trials, though the policy stopped short of making data sharing mandatory.9 The implementation of the current policy has been inconsistent, and it is estimated that less than a third of ICMJE-affiliated journals have adopted a data sharing policy.10 Beyond a commitment to share data, actual reuse of data requires additional resources and technical infrastructure, which may contribute to the low rates of data reuse seen in practice. Guiding principles have been established to facilitate sharing and effective data reuse, calling for all data to be FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.11 Implementation of such a framework across pediatric clinical trials will require not only greater data transparency and incentivization in our research community, but also consistent use of standard pediatric terminologies and pediatric-specific data ontologies.To act on the findings reported by Brewster et al, we must build consensus across the pediatric clinical trial enterprise on key features and trial outcomes deemed essential to maximizing resources and advancing pediatric clinical care. These could include measures of trial discontinuation, results reporting, and data sharing and reuse. Using a standard set of metrics, a data-driven approach could be applied to monitoring activities and directing modification and strengthening of research infrastructures, governing policies, and investment strategies. Formalizing ongoing evaluation would provide the needed tools to efficiently advance pediatric clinical trial infrastructures and maximize benefits to child health.","The FAIR principles are an important part of maximizing the impact of pediatric clinical trials.

To prepare FAIR data, a new data science discipline known as data stewardship is emerging and, as the FAIR Guidelines gain more acceptance, an increase in the demand for data stewards is expected. Consequently, there is a need to develop curricula to foster professional skills in data stewardship through effective knowledge communication. There have been a number of initiatives aimed at bridging the gap in FAIR data management training through both formal and informal programmes. This article describes the experience of developing a digital initiative for FAIR data management training under the Digital Innovations and Skills Hub (DISH) project. The FAIR Data Management course offers 6 short on-demand certificate modules over 12 weeks. The modules are divided into two sets: FAIR data and data science. The core subjects cover elementary topics in data science, regulatory frameworks, FAIR data management, intermediate to advanced topics in FAIR Data Point installation, and FAIR data in the management of healthcare and semantic data. Each week, participants are required to devote 7–8 hours of self-study to the modules, based on the resources provided. Once they have satisfied all requirements, students are certified as FAIR data scientists and qualified to serve as both FAIR data stewards and analysts. It is expected that in-depth and focused curricula development with diverse participants will build a core of FAIR data scientists for Data Competence Centres and encourage the rapid adoption of the FAIR Guidelines for research and development.</jats:p>","The FAIR Guidelines are designed to make digital data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
